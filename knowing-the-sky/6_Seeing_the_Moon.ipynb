    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shinnecock are a federally recognized tribe based in eastern Long Island. Like many other tribes along the eastern seaboard, colonialism caused great hardship and loss for the Shinnecock. Land is put at the center of the colonialism discussion, but land is what the colonists gained; it is only the beginning of what indigenous tribes lost. Traditional language, ceremonies, and cultural practices were outlawed; children were taken away from their families; Shinnecock men were left to die on ships in storms while products were given preference to be taken ashore first. \n",
    "\n",
    "For several generations, the Shinnecock have been attempting to bring back lost cultural traditions, much of which has been done by travelling to other closely related communities and re-learning our ways. One of the recently revived traditions is the *Full Moon Ceremony* in which female members of the tribe honor _Nukimis Nanapashot_ (Grandmother Moon Spirit). The women of the tribe are tied to the water, the moon, and its calendar. Each month, when the moon is full and its power strongest, this ceremony is held to allow the participants to cleanse themselves and their energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, in Western science, the Moon is considered full on one particular date in the synodic month (New Moon to New Moon). However, this strict concept of fullness is not adhered to in the ceremonies. You may have noticed that the Moon \"looks full\" for a few days before and after the exact date of the full Moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use computer vision, in particular morphological analysis, to explore the fullness of the Moon and compare this to the dates on which the ceremony is permitted to be held."

    "Currently, Full Moon Ceremonies are practiced within three days on either side of the full Moon. Here we will use publicly available data to quantify the illumination percentage of the Moon throughout the higher illumination periods of its cycle, and relate this to the visual appearance of the Moon during the times in which the ceremony is practiced. Subsequently we'll use this information to back-compute possible ceremony dates from the past using ephemeris information."

    "### Background on the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis we will need a dataset of full-disk images of the Moon in various phases. Luckily, there are plenty of satellites that use the Moon to calibrate their instruments. They contribute to the [GLOD (GSICS Lunar\n",
    "Observation Dataset)](http://gsics.atmos.umd.edu/bin/view/Development/LunarWorkArea) which accumulates the lunar data taken from these satellites to create a calibration model using the Moon. Unfortunately, the GLOD is not publicly shareable. However, the data of many of the satellites that contribute to it _are_ public. We will focus on the GOES-R series (that's GOES-16, GOES-17, and GOES-18) satellites [ABI instruments](https://www.goes-r.gov/spacesegment/abi.html). The data that these instruments use for calibration with the moon contains `LUN` in the filenames and can be obtained from [NOAA CLASS GRICABI dataset](https://www.aev.class.noaa.gov/saa/products/search?sub_id=0&datatype_family=GRICABI&submit.x=18&submit.y=6).\n",
    "\n",
    "In generating this training we downloaded the entirety of the LUN dataset for all three satellites up to that date, and ran them all through the exercise you'll be doing here. That was about 700 GB and it's unrealistic to expect you to reproduce that scale of work! Instead, we've curated a small subset of the dataset so you can learn the same techniques (without having to go through the delay of waiting for your data order through NOAA CLASS or overloading your harddrive).\n",
    "\n",
    "We've also massaged the data to make it a bit easier to work with. These files have been downsized to only include the data relevant for this exercise (radiance). The original GOES files also contain 2 or 4 frames within the same array. We have dissected and separated these arrays so each file represents only one frame. This merged frame style is something we only find in the calibration data, so if you work with GOES atmospheric data this isn't a step you'd need to consider. For a deeper dive into the preprocessing steps that were performed and how we chose the files to include in this subset you can check out the functions we used (which have docstrings with detailed descriptions) [here](https://gist.github.com/Sierra-MC/4aa3eb54ec3ce4ebeafac44468b61a1a).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the data subset here: https://kts-dev-data.s3.amazonaws.com/goes/goes_subset_flat.tar.gz\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to decompress (\"ungzip\" and \"untar\") the subset in order to use the data. Head to lesson 1 if you need a refresher on how to do that."

    "### NetCDF and Data Exploration\n",
    "[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is a data storage format for scientific array-oriented data. It is very popular, especially in the Earth Sciences, and contains metadata within the same file as the data itself. GOES data is served in NetCDF format and the most recent version of the software used to open it, also named NetCDF, is currently NetCDF4 (at the time of writing this training). Let's begin by importing the python library to work with NetCDF data ([`netCDF4`](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/)) and opening one of our files to get a feel for what this format looks like."
