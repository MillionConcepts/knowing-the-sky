'J2000' is a vague term: it can refer to any coordinate system referenced to the celestial equator and equinox of January 1st, 2000 TT (Terrestrial Time -- like Atomic Time but with a small offset), and there are several such systems. *todo: more about transforming time systems? this level of precision is not actually important for this problem...* Usually, however, it refers to an equatorial coordinate system whose origin is at the barycenter of the Solar System, and is interchangeable for most purposes with the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS). **todo, maybe: do i need to talk about what an equatorial coordinate system is? does it matter?**\n",

    "An equatorial system is a type of inertial coordinate system. Inertial coordinate systems are acceleration-independent and very useful for specifying precise positions and orientations of objects in different accelerational frames. However, body-fixed systems, which move with a particular object such as a planet, and topocentric systems, which are relative to a particular observer, are often more useful for determining _apparent_ positions and trajectories of objects.\n",
