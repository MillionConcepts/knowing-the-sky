    "### Introduction\n",
    "Prior to the invention and widespread adoption of personal clocks, many cultures looked to celestial movements as a way to navigate and track time, including Native American tribes. Some tribes, such as the Shinnecock, traditionally look to the moon as their main timekeeper, incorporating additional information from observations of specific plant species blooming or fruiting, or the behavior of animals such as the geese migrating south. Similarly, the Salish would observe the appearance and behavior of various bird species as well as use the changing positions of stars to track the passage of time. During his anthropological research of the Salish people, Claude Schaffer conducted interviews and made observations of how time and the seasons were recorded. In his notes, Schaffer refers to a constellation known as Čspéʔl̓č̓s Kʷkʷusm̓ which translates to _seven stars_. From the perspective in the Salish territory (which mainly covers Western Montana), this constellation moves across the sky and ends the night directly overhead when day breaks. As the seasons progress, the constellation starts the night at different areas of the sky. These changes in position mark the passing of the seasons as Čspéʔl̓č̓s Kʷkʷusm̓ made it's journey to the zenith (and therefore the night) longer during the winter. Schaffer interpreted that the _seven stars_ constellation is the same set of stars referred to as the _Big Dipper_ by Western astronomy.\n",
    "However, along with this well described account of the movement of the Čspéʔl̓č̓s Kʷkʷusm̓, there is a shorter, more vague, but equally as interesting note:\n",
    "\n",
    "> There was a group of three stars that rose from the place that was between the sun and the moon and it never changed its positon of rising.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is here that we will begin our investigation. Which three stars are being referred to? How can we use available datasets to determine this? We'll begin by learning the basics of acquiring data using Python."

    "### Acquiring Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you're doing pure simulations --- and sometimes even then --- you'll usually need source data for scientific programming. Often the seemingly simple steps of finding, acquiring, and figuring out how to 'open' data can take as much time as analyzing it. Many of us have been spoiled by modern search engines and data standardization; but digital astronomical data predates the even the existence of modern computers! Fortunately, and by the collective effort of tens of thousands of computer programmers and scientists, many excellent open source libraries and tools exist to make these tasks easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technology that underlies the following examples is called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or, more commonly, just HTTP -- an abbreviation that's probably familiar to you from your browser URL bar. HTTP is the primary \"application layer\" protocol used to access content on the Internet and to interact with online services, including cloud services. Applications use HTTP by issuing \"requests\" of various types, most commonly `GET` (retrieve data), `PUT`, and `POST` (which both send data). Servers respond to HTTP requests by sending HTTP \"responses\", which can contain both data and metadata about the response. HTTP metadata are called \"headers\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Most popular programming languages offer ways to make HTTP requests and interpret HTTP responses, and Python is no exception. One of the best Python libraries for doing this is unsurprisingly called `requests`."

If there are more --- especially if the URLs are regularly constructed, in a list you can load into memory, or subject to change based on other parts of your program --- it's often better to do it with code.\n",

    "### File Management\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with scientific data, you'll often find yourself working with a large number of files, or with very large files. Both of these can present difficulties! Large numbers of files are difficult to organize. Individually, large files can take a long time to download and open, and use up a lot of local storage space. Processing them without great care can use up a lot of your computer's working memory (RAM), leading to sluggish performance or even crashes. \n",
    "\n",
    "These problems are made worse by the fact that scientific files often have long, complicated filenames. Although they can contain a lot of useful information, they are hard to read until you are very used to a specific data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's also likely you'll find yourself writing a lot of files containing data you've processed with your own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This all means that good file management is very important. It helps you avoid spending lots of time poking around and opening random files to find what you're looking for -- or, worse, losing your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is good file management? A lot of it comes down to personal preference or specific project needs, and there are many tools for it that you may find useful, but the most straightforward thing to do is to leverage the built-in capabilities of your filesystem, and that's what we'll do on this project. Filesystems are great! Every computer and every programming language knows how to work with them, and it is easy to click through folders in a file manager application and explore them with code. Here are some guidelines that work for most people:\n",
    "* Keep files for a specific project in a single folder 'tree'.\n",
    "* Name and organize folders in a way that makes sense to you -- keep similar files together and give folders names you will remember.\n",
    "* Similarly, choose a clear, expressive naming convention for any files you write yourself.\n",
    "* Don't put too many files in a single folder -- this makes it hard to browse and can also reduce performance. 100 is about the limit.\n",
    "* Keep code and data files in separate folders.\n",
    "* Make sure you know where new files are going. For example, when you download a file from the Internet using your browser, it often goes into a Downloads folder. It's good to know where that is in your filesystem so that you can actually use those files.\n",
    "* Keep new files that you write (output data) separate from files you've acquired from other sources (input data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python ecosystem, including just the Standard Library, has many tools to work with local filesystems. Let's look at a couple of common patterns."

These will make it hard to use straightforwardly, so let's \"ungzip\" and \"untar\" the file save it to disk. This will also show you a number of useful patterns for working with compressed files and directories in Python! (Uncompressed astronomical data and catalogs are often quite large. But they also often compress quite efficiently for reasons that are beyond the scope of this tutorial to explain. For this reason, astronomical data are routinely stored and transmitted in a lossless compression format like `gzip`.)"
