    "## arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are one of the most important data structures in scientific programming, and, for that matter, practical mathematics more generally -- they are a basic pattern used in many systems and cultures. Computers are very good at working with them, so knowing how to manipulate them effectively is extremely powerful. If you are reading this, it is entirely possible you have extensive experience with array data. Things may be different in Python than other languages, though, so we recommend not skipping it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### what is an array?\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, an array is simply a regular grid of 'elements', which are often but not always numbers. It can be 1-D, 2-D, 3-D, or even more. A 1-D array is a lot like a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can access elements in an array by coordinates, which means that they work like coordinate spaces. This is *very* useful for scientific programming. You can also perform mathematical operations on an entire array at once, which is both convenient and typically much faster than performing the same operations on each element one-by-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "(footnote for the mathematically inclined): an array is *not* a vector, matrix, or tensor, but it can be used to *represent* a vector, matrix, or tensor. \n",
    "\n",
    "### how do you work with arrays in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "`numpy` is the most common library for creating and manipulating arrays. Most scientific programs use `numpy` at some point, partly because many other libraries use it 'under the hood'. A very important point is that raster images (images made up of pixels, as opposed to vector images) can always be converted to and from arrays, which means that arrays let you do very powerful image manipulation. Let's start with a very quick introduction to the most important parts of the `numpy` library."

Fortunately, Python offers many tools for summarizing and visualizing arrays. \n",

    "Before we start exploring, we need to deal with the fact that lots of scientific data -- including this image -- contain 'nonfinite' values: `nan` (not-a-number, sometimes called 'null', used for missing or invalid entries), `inf` (infinity), and `-inf` (negative infinity). This means many statistical tools will fail on them out of the box: what, after all, is the mean of 2, 3, and not-a-number? There are several ways to work with data despite nonfinite values. The most powerful tool `numpy` provides is the masked array, which allows you to ignore specific elements and work with the array just like you would otherwise. A caveat: not all libraries 'respect' masked arrays, so you may have to do fancier tricks when working with some tools. However, many do. We'll show a common trick for dealing with libraries that don't a little further down."

    "Tables are basically arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ok, but what is a table, really?\n",
    "A table is _like_ an array, with the following differences:\n",
    "* 'Table' implies 2-D: it has rows and columns and nothing else.\n",
    "* The columns of a table are also called 'fields', and have\n",
    "    *meanings* that are distinct from one another: for instance, a table created from a radiometer \n",
    "    on a satellite might have fields representing time, latitude, longitude, and brightness temperature;\n",
    "    individual rows would represent individual observations.\n",
    "    * This is different from arrays, where, in general, every element has a roughly equivalent *meaning*, but in a different *place*.\n",
    "* A table can have more than one data type: for instance, a star catalog might have a field representing\n",
    "    right ascension in 64-bit floating-point numbers, and a field representing star names as strings.\n",
    "* **todo: maybe not necessary here** A table also generally has an 'index', which can be \n",
    "    a numerical series that simply corresponds to row number, but can be something else\n",
    "    entirely -- for instance, a table of personnel data might be indexed by employee ID number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like arrays, tables are of ancient origin and found in many forms in many contexts, but computers really like to work with them. Tables are even more widely used than arrays in general-purpose computing. Common examples include spreadsheets and SQL databases. The world runs on tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tabular file formats\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Broad categories: binary vs. text\n",
    "Tables can be stored in many formats. The two major _categories_ of format are binary and text tables. Text table formats store values as human-readable strings, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "| RA | DEC |\n",
    "| ------ | ----- |\n",
    "| 17.222 | -12.301 |\n",
    "| 17.223 | -12.311 |\n",
    "| 17.222 | -12.323 |\n",
    "\n",
    "These sorts of tables are relatively easy to look at and manipulate in spreadsheet programs or text editors -- unless they get so big that the program will refuse to load them!\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, binary table formats store values as raw bytes. The number of bytes per entry depends on the underlying data type. They are poorly human-readable, but tend to use less disk space and be quicker to load than text tables. As 32-bit floating point numbers expressed in bytes, the preceding table might look like:\n",
    "| | |\n",
    "|-|-|\n",
    "| \\xa8\\xc6\\x89 | \\xe5\\xd0D\\xc1 |\n",
    "| \\xb4\\xc8\\x89A | \\xe5\\xd0D\\xc1 |\n",
    "| \\xa8\\xc6\\x89 | \\x02+E\\xc1 |\n",
    "\n",
    "This is about 50% smaller in terms of data volume than the text version, but most people are not going to get much out of just _looking_ at it, and trying to manipulate it by copy-pasting would be fruitless. To use it, you need to load it into software that will translate it into meaningful numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some binary table formats simply contain encoded values. Other formats embed metadata along with the values (for instance, cell colors in an Excel file). These formats tend to be harder to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upshot of all this is that really large tables -- tables that you wouldn't be able to visually scan, or maybe even successfully load, in a spreadsheet or text editor -- should almost always be stored in binary formats. Small tables are fine to store as text. If you're only planning to use them as intermediate data, though, small tables might also just as well be binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics of some specific formats\n",
    "There are many, many tabular data formats. This is not an exhaustive list, but here are some common formats you are likely to encounter in planetary science and astronomy:\n",
    "\n",
    "**DSV (delimiter-separated value)**\n",
    "\n",
    "DSV is a family of text table formats that place each row on a separate line, and separates columns with a special delimiter character, usually a comma or a tab (a tab is represented by '\\t' in most programming languages). Comma-separated tables are often called CSV, and tab-separated TSV. This is a CSV table:\n",
    "```\n",
    "satellite,1.002,-379,True\n",
    "unknown,1.547,-22,False\n",
    "```\n",
    "Common file extensions for DSV files are .csv, .tsv, .txt, and .tab, but there are many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**FWF (fixed-width file)**\n",
    "\n",
    "FWF is a text table format that places each row on a separate line, and separates columns by defining a specific 'width' -- number of characters -- for each column. These columns may also have whitespace 'padding' to make them easier to read (and for programs to figure out how to parse them if they don't have the definition available). FWF files were traditionally easier for programs to read than DSV files, but this is no longer true. In general, we recommend choosing DSV formats over FWF, because the delimiters make it easier for a wider variety of programs to parse them, they are usually a little smaller (because not every row has to be the same width), and you are less likely to make mistakes if you edit them manually. This is a fixed-width version of the DSV table above:\n",
    "```\n",
    "satellite 1.002 -379 True \n",
    "unknown   1.547 -22  False\n",
    "```\n",
    ".tab and .txt are common file extensions for FWF, but, like DSV, providers often exercise creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Excel (and other spreadsheet formats)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Spreadsheet files are generally binary tables with embedded metadata that allow spreadsheet programs to retain formatting like fonts, cell colors, and sheet breaks. These are usually *proprietary* formats: although they can be reverse-engineered, the makers of the software do not publish specifications for them, and they are subject to change between software versions. This means that they are poorly portable and not very future-proof. For these reasons, we do not recommend exchanging scientific data in spreadsheet formats, and most spreadsheet software can easily export data in standard formats like CSV. Most spreadsheet formats have extensions that indicate the specific software used to produce them: for instance, Excel uses .xlsx or .xls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FITS**\n",
    "\n",
    "FITS files, which were invented for astronomy but have seen widespread adoption in other scientific disciplines, can contain either binary or text tables (although FITS text tables are rarely used in practice). Because FITS files, as we discussed earlier, can have multiple HDUs, a single FITS file can contain multiple tables. FITS files usually have a .fits or .fit extension. We think FITS is one of the best ways to save tables due to its widespread support and mature, stable standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PDS binary tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many tabular data products in the PDS have ad-hoc structures they describe in external metadata. Standards differ between PDS3 and PDS4. In PDS3, structures can be defined in either their attached or detached PDS3 labels, or in an arbitrary number of distinct format (.fmt) files. In PDS4, binary table structure must be completely defined in a file's detached XML (.xml) label. Common extensions for these files include .dat and .tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL databases**\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO: maybe skip this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parquet**\n",
    "\n",
    "Parquet is a newer tabular interchange format that has seen wide adoption in industry and is increasingly common in scientific contexts. It is a _columnar_ format, which means that every field is stored in a distinct area and can be both compressed and readily accessed individually, which makes it very efficient for many purposes. We think Parquet is also an excellent choice for tabular data, especially very large tables that you don't want to load into memory all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**general-purpose data formats**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, while this category is much to broad to detail, it's worth noting that tables can also be represented in structured data formats that aren't specialized for tables, like Javascript Object Notation (JSON) and Extended Markup Language (XML). (In fact, Excel files rely in part on a compressed and modified version of XML!) Features of programming languages that save in-memory objects to disk, like Python `pickle` files or MATLAB .mat files, can similarly be used to store tables -- but then they can only be opened in that programming language! We don't recommend doing this unless you have a really good reason to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO: maybe something about headers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with tables in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many packages for working with tabular data in Python. `pandas` is by far the most common, and it's what we'll mostly use in this book. `pandas` has built-in support for reading and writing a wide variety of table formats, but not all, so you'll sometimes need to use a helper package to load data into `pandas`. For instance, `pandas` can't read FITS tables, so you'll need to go through a specialty FITS library like `astropy.io.fits` or `fitsio`. Similarly, to read tables described in PDS metadata, you'll need to use a library like `pdr` or `pds4-tools`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as you saw in the previous lesson, people often compress table files 'monolithically', wrapping the whole file at once in a compression format like gzip. Some packages can decompress files like this automatically, but most can't, so you'll often need to decompress table files before you can use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` is very, very powerful; however, it has many features that don't follow a common idiom, so it needs to be used with care. Let's move on to some basic ways to use `pandas`. We'll use the Bright Star Catalog as our sample data."
