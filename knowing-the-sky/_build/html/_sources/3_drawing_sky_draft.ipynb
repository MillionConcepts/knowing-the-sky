    "## coordinate transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "The version of the Bright Star Catalog we fetched through Vizier defines star coordinates in 'J2000'. 'J2000' is a vague term: it can refer to any coordinate system referenced to the celestial equator and equinox of January 1st, 2000 TT (Terrestrial Time -- like Atomic Time but with a small offset), and there are several such systems. *todo: more about transforming time systems? this level of precision is not actually important for this problem...* Usually, however, it refers to an equatorial coordinate system whose origin is at the barycenter of the Solar System, and is interchangeable for most purposes with the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS). **todo, maybe: do i need to talk about what an equatorial coordinate system is? does it matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An equatorial system is a type of inertial coordinate system. Inertial coordinate systems are acceleration-independent and very useful for specifying precise positions and orientations of objects in different accelerational frames. However, body-fixed systems, which move with a particular object such as a planet, and topocentric systems, which are relative to a particular observer, are often more useful for determining _apparent_ positions and trajectories of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transforming coordinates into other systems is one of the most common tasks in computing for planetary science and astronomy. The scientific Python ecosystem offers many tools to facilitate this task, and some of the most straightforward ones live in `astropy`."
