ontheir customs and tales. The following collection oftraditions
wasmade inconnection with these researches. Acollection of
Lillooet talesmade byMr. Teit,andpublished inthe"Journal of

FOLK-TALES OFSALISHAN TRIBES.^
I.THOMPSON TALES, BYJAMES A.TEIT.
I.Coyote Tales.
(l)THEORIGIN OFDEATH.^
(From Nicola Valley.)
Coyote was travelling, andcame toRaven, abad, selfish chief,
whowanted tomake everything difficult forother people, andeasy
forhimself. Hewanted thegame forhimself, wanted long winters,
andhedidnotwantman tobeimmortal. Coyote questioned him
astowhyhewanted people todie.Hesaid, "Ifpeople were im-
mortal, there would betoomany. Letthembecome sickand die."
Coyote said,"Why should they die? Death willintroduce sorrow
intotheworld, andsorrow isvery hard. Ifthey die,what willbecome
ofthem? Where willthey go? Letthem besick, butnotdie."
Raven said,"No, theymust die. Idonotwishourenemies tolive
forever. Ifthepeople should become toonumerous, therewould be
nofood,andtheywould behungry. Itisbetter forthem todie."
Raven's people supported their chief, andclamored forthepeople
todie. Raven, Crow, Fly,Maggot, andmany others wanted people
todie,sothattheymight feedoncorpses. Coyote said,"Let people
dieforawhile, andthencome tolifeagain. Letdeath belikesleep."
Raven said,"No, ifthey die, letthem dieforgood, and lettheir
bodies rot." AtlastCoyote agreed, and said, "Well, itisordained
that people shall diewhen their time hascome. Their bodies shall
beburied, and their souls shall gotothespirit-land; but this will
onlybeuntil theworld changes again, when they willdienomore."
Shortly after that. Raven's daughter became sickand died. She
wasthe first todie.Raven tried torestore hertolife,but failed.
Then hewept because ofhisdaughter. Hewent toCoyote, andsaid,
"Let uschange whatwesaid before. Donot letpeople dieand
remain dead forever. Letuschange it!" Coyote answered, "No,
itissettled now, andcannot bealtered." Thus ithappens that
people dieandareburied.
1Unless stated otherwise, thetales contained inthischapter were collected among the
Upper Thompson.

(2)COYOTE STEALS FIRE.^
{From Nicola Valley.)
From thetopofamountain Coyote sawalight faraway tothe
south. Hedidnotknowwhat itwas.Hedefecated, andquestioned
hisexcrements.^ They said,"That isfire." Hemadeuphismind to
goandget it.Many people accompanied him. Fox,Wolf, Antelope,
and allthegood runners went with him. After travelling along dis-
tance, they reached thehouse oftheFire people. They toldthem,
"We havecome tovisit you, todance, toplay, and togamble."
They prepared foradance that night. Coyote made ahead-dress
ofpitchy yellow-pine shavings, with long fringes ofdrycedar-bark
reaching totheground. TheFirepeople danced first. The firewas
very low.Then Coyote and hispeople danced inacircle around the
fire.They complained that they could not see.Then theFire
people made alarge fire. Coyote complained four times, and finally
they letthe fireblazeuphigh. Coyote's people pretended tobevery
hot,andwent outtocoolthemselves. They tookuppositions for
running. Only Coyote was left.Hedanced about wildly until his
head-dress took fire.Hepretended tobeafraid, andrequested the
Firepeople toput itout.They warned himnottodance soclose
tothe fire.When near thedoor, heswung thelong fringes ofhis
head-dress across the fire,andranout.TheFirepeople pursued him.
Hegave hishead-band toAntelope, whoranandpassed itontothe
nextrunner. Thus they carried itinrelays.^ TheFirepeople caught
upwith theanimals, and killed them onebyone. OnlyCoyote was
left.They nearly caught upwithhim ;butheranbehind atree,and
gave the firetoit.Then hechanged himself intodung. The Fire
people looked forhistracks, looked upthe tree,andexamined the
excrements. They could notfindanything. They caused thewind
torise,andtheburning fragments ofbark thathad fallen hereand
there setfiretothegrass. They said,"Coyote willnowburn up."
Aheavy smoke arose, andCoyote escaped. The firespread allover
thecountry, andburned upmany people. Coyote caused aheavy
rainfall andaflood, which putoutthe fire. After thisthefirewasin
the trees, andgrass and trees could beused formaking fire. For
thisreason drycedar-bark carries fire,andcanbeused forslow-
matches. Forthisreason, also,pitch-wood ignites easily, and isused
forstarting fires. Since then there have beensmoke and fireinthe
world, andthetwoareinseparable. Smoke isalways asign offire,
andwindmakes fireblaze up.For thisreason people blowonfire.

(3)COYOTE AND ELK.^
{From Nicola Valley.)
After Coyote hadintroduced thesalmon, made fishing-utensils,
andshown thepeople how tofish,prepare, andcuresalmon, hewent
toanother country. Thepeople there didnotknowhow tohunt.
They tried, butobtained very littlegame, because theanimals were
afraid ofthem. They used clubsandstones forkilling them; andas
thedeerandothergame runfastandjump far,theyhadgreat difficulty
inkilling anything. The game-animals, even thedeer,were not
afraid ofthepeople, andoften chased them. Some kinds ofgame
even hunted andatepeople.
OnedayCoyote metsome people running. Heasked themwhy
theywere running. They said,"Elk ishunting us.Hewill killand
eatus." Coyote said,"Why don't you killhim?" They answered,
"We areafraid. He ismore powerful thanweare." Coyote went
on,andsoonmetaBull Elk.Heasked himwhere hewasgoing;
andhesaid, "Iamhunting formywives." Coyote asked him,
"Doyou killpeople?" andheanswered, "Yes, sometimes." Coyote
transformed him intoacommon elk, saying, "Henceforth people
shallhuntand killyou." ThenCoyote taught thepeople howtomake
bowsandarrows; how tohunt, cutup,andcuremeat; andhow to
dress skins. After thistheyhunted deerandother game.
(4)COYOTE ANDDEER.
{From Nicola Valley.)
Coyote (orsome other being) said,"Deer willbegame andfood
fortheIndians. There willbedeeraslong asthere areIndians. If
theIndians disappear, sowillthedeer." Itwasordained thisway.
The deerwere always animals. They were created asgame, and
food forpeople. They were hunted bytheancients, andcontinue
tobehunted bytheIndians ofthepresent day. Since they aremere
game-animals, they could notactastheancients did,andthere are
notales telling ofthem ashuman beings.
(5)COYOTE, FOX,ANDTHESUNPEOPLE.^
{From Nicola Valley.)
Coyote andFox (orWolf) were travelling. They went near the
Sun's house. There theysawabaghanging from theendofapole.
They asked each other,"What isinthatbag?" Neither could tell.
Foxsmoked hispipe,andquestioned it.Thepipeanswered, "Sun-

rays." Coyote defecated, and questioned hisexcrements. They
answered, "Hot wind." Now, they disputed astowhowas right.
FoxtoldCoyote topulldown thebag. Coyote tried invain toreach
it.Then hetried topush overthepole. Hejumped atit,andtried
toperforate itwith theendofhisarrow-flaker. Finally hesucceeded
inpiercing itatthebottom, andmade asmall hole. Something
bright came out. Fox said,"That must beasun-ray; pull itdown!"
Coyote tookhold ofit,andburned hishand. Fox said,"Iwillshoot
it."Hehitthebagwithalarge- pointed arrow andburst it.Then
thehotwind andthesun-rays came outandmade agreat noise.
Coyote andFoxranaway. Thepeople inthelodge heard thenoise
when thebagburst. They ranout,andpursued Coyote andFox.
When thesewerenearly overtaken, theyturned around, andthreatened
toshoot theSunpeople. The latter atoncebecame afraid, andran
back.
(6)COYOTE TEACHES PEOPLE TOMATE.
{From Nicola Valley.)
Coyote was travelling, andcame toacountry where livedmenand
women whoknew nothow topropagate. Heshowed themhow to

women ofthatcountry bore children.
(7)COYOTE ANDTHEMARMOTS.^
{From Upper Uta'mgt andNicola Valley.)
Coyote came toapass inthemountains (some sayonUpper Salmon
River) inhabited bytwoMarmots, who satoneoneach sidebehind
rocks. When people passed through, they clashed therocks together
and killed them. Nothing could pass through except thewind.
Coyote heard them, anddetermined topassthrough. When hewas
inthemiddle, therocks began toshut; butheplaced hisarrow-flaker
ofantler across, andtheycould notshut. Hetransformed theMar-
mots intoanimals, andtherocks into stationary cliffs. There isa
narrow passage between two cliffs, through which thetrailpasses now.

drink. When theysawbytheir reflections howuglytheyhadbecome,
they quarrelled, each blaming theother forbeing thecause ofhis

{From Nicola Valley.)
Coyote killed some young ground-squirrels, andmade ahole in
which tobake them. Hestood waiting forthem tobedone. He
noticed arock near by,andthought, "Iamtired ofstanding; why

butthatFoxcaused Coyote tostick toit.

Coyote andFoxwere half-brothers (orcousins). They often played
tricks oneach other. OnceCoyote hadfound acarcass (orhad killed
some game), which hebegan tocook inapit.While hewaswaiting
under abranchy tree forthemeat tobedone, hefellasleep. Fox
came along andcaused thetree tofallonCoyote, whocould notget

meat, andbegged himtoleave some; butFoxate itallbefore Coyote
could getaway.

Another timeFoxfastened arattle tohis tail,andCoyote wanted
toget it.Fox toldhim itwasdangerous, andthatonlyhehimself
•could wear it;butCoyote persisted, soFoxfastened ittoCoyote's
tail,andwarned himnottogothrough anybrush. Heknew that

andthat theWoodpeckers pecked aholeandtookhim out.Some
addthatthey pulled himoutbythe tail.
(19)THEMOSQUITOES.^
Formerly mosquitoes werevery large, fierce, andatepeople. Mos-
quito and hiswife lived inahouse attheedge ofthetimber, neara
swamp. They hunted people, andkilled thembysucking their blood.
Mosquito hunted onlywomen, and hiswifehunted onlymen. They
preferred theblood from theprivates ofpeople. Coyote orsome
other transformer turned them intomosquitoes, saying, "Henceforth
you shall besmall insects, and shall frequent swamps andwoods.
You shall beable tosuck alittle blood only. You shall nothave
power tokillpeople."
(20)THECANNIBAL WHOUSEDANELKASADECOY.
Coyote (orsome other transformer) was travelling, andcame toa
place where acannibal lived inalarge hollow tree.Heused asa
decoy astuffed elk-skin, which hekeptwithin arrow range onanopen
flatnear alake-shore. When ahunter stalked the elk,thecannibal
shotandatehim.Many bones andskulls werearound thebase ofthe
tree. Coyote defecated, andmade hisexcrements whistle. When
thecannibal looked outofthetopofthetree, thinking thatsome one
was there, Coyote entered thetreeandshot thecannibal, whom he
hitintheanus.^

corner oftheblanket andlooked in.Hedidnotseeanyone.He
thought, "Iwilltake thisblanket," andwent offwith it.When he

ItwasSweat-House-Man, ortheWind, whohadcome topunish
Coyote. When Coyote woke up,hefound himself inthemiddle ofa
swamp, bruised andbleeding, stung bymosquitoes, and hisclothes
alltorn. Hiseyesandbody were swollen, andsmarting frommos-
quito-bites. The sand-fiies hadcrawled into hismouth, nose, ears,
andanus,andinfested hishair.Heextricated himself with difficulty,
and aftersome tiresome travelling inthemudhecame outofthe
swamp. ^Theblanket wentback toSweat-House-Man.

theywere thebest kind, whereas they areabout theworst kind of
berries.
(23)COYOTE ANDTHEROLLING BOWLDER.^
{From upper Utd'mgt andNicola Valley.)
Coyote was travelling somewhere intheUpper Uta'mqt country,
andcame toaside-hill where there were bowlders atthefoot ofa
cliff. Below, theside-hill wassmooth. Abowlder lived here, that
killed people byrolling onthem. Coyote didnotknow which one
itwas,andquestioned hisexcrements. They toldhim. Thebowlder
wasalong distance above him.When hewasbelow it,heheard a
noise, andsaw itcoming. Hestuck hisdouble-headed arrow-flaker
into theground withoneendpointing uphill. When thebowlder
hitthepoint, itbroke intofragments. Atthisplace there isapatch
ofsharp fragments ofwhite rock. Hesaid, "Henceforth bowlders
shall not killpeople byrolling downhill. People shall beable to
getoutoftheirway."

sawmuch fallen timber andlowbrush, andmany Rabbits inthebushes.
Hewasveryhungry, andmuch desired tocatchsome Rabbits. They
sawhimandapproached him. They called oneanother, andalarge
number came. Coyote pretended tobedead. Soon they recognized
him,andsaid,"Oh, itisCoyote! Heisdead!" Then theywerevery
glad,andbegan todance. That night theysanganddanced, passing
closebyCoyote. Theymade funofhimandrejoiced athisdeath.
Suddenly heopened heeyes,jumped up,andclubbed anumber of
them.
(25)THESISTERS WHOMARRIED COYOTE ANDLYNX.^
{From Spences Bridge.)
When Coyote made coldweather, andranahead with hishouse
onhisback tointercept thetwo sisters, theysawthelodge withsmoke
issuing from it,andsaid,"Some onelives there; wewillgoandwarm
ourselves." Coyote gavethem fattoeatonabark platter. The
elder sister thought itdidnotlook exactly like fat,andadvised her
younger sister nottoeat it;butthelatter, whowasvery hungry,
tasted it.Theelder sister threw some ofthefatintothe fire,andsaw
that itcracked anddidnotburn likereal fat:therefore sherefused to
eat it.After receiving instructions fromCoyote astothedirection
oftheir grandmother, Mountain-Sheep, they departed. When they
hadgoneashort distance, Coyote called after them,"Ifthechild isa
boy,save it! Ifitisagirl,hang ituponatreeandleave it!"The
elder sister thought thiswasastrange thing tosay,andatoncecon-
cluded thatheryounger sister waspregnant, because shehadeaten
the fat.Shesaid toher,"Let usjump fourtimes!" Theyjumped
fourtimes, andthentheyoungerfeister gave birth toaboy.The fatthat
shehadeaten wasCoyote's dried semen. Again Coyote putdown
hishouse ahead ofthem, andproduced coldweather. The sisters
went intowarm themselves. Coyote made himself look likeanother
man, buttheelder sister recognized him.When Coyote ofTered them
fat,shethrew both dishand fatinto the fireand reviled Coyote.
Theyounger sister andherbaby remained with Coyote; while the
elder sisterwent on,carrying herbasket androot-digger.

heard thesound ofsome oneadzing, andsoon shesawhergrand-
mother splitting wood. Shesatdown ontheendofthelogatwhich

kept the girl. Mountain-Sheep canbeatanyanimal inrunning ina
broken country. Theyoung menwere angry, because theoldwoman
haddeceived them, andLynxmade uphismind topossess the girl.
(Here follows theincident oftheLynx spitting onthegirl.)
(26)THECOYOTE PEOPLE.^
Coyote married awoman, andhadmany children byher.From
these children aredescended theSalish tribes. TheThompson are
thedescendants ofone; theShuswap, ofanother; Okanagon and Lil-
looet, ofothers. Therefore thelanguages ofthese tribes arerelated.
The Chilcotin and Carriers must beofdifferent parentage. Some
saythey arethedescendants ofDeer orBird people. TheLower
Fraser andCoast people arealso different. Onaccount ofthisstory
theThompson andShuswap areoften called "Coyote people" in
stories.
(27)OLD-COYOTE ANDTHECOYOTE PEOPLE.
{From Nicola Valley.)
Old-Coyote (he iscalled "Uncle Coyote" bysome) wastheancestor
ofalltheIndians. Hehadmany wives. From some aredescended
theThompson, from others theOkanagon, from stillothers theShu-
swap. One ofhissons (probably Ntli'kisEntEm) hadtwo wives,
Lu'la andTce'xa (varieties ofducks) .Thelatter hadasimple-minded
sister, theFrog,whoacted asherservant. Shefollowed herwherever
shewent. LikeCoyote himself, many ofhissonshadmagical powers.
Many ofthem leftdescendants. AsCoyote travelled over alarge
part oftheworld, heleftchildren inmany places. The Salish,
Kalispel, Nez Perces, Yakima, and Blackfeet, and alltheinterior
tribes, have sprung from Coyote's children. Because these tribes
sprang from Coyote, they arecalled "Coyote people."
Some saythatthepeople were notactually descendants ofCoyote,
butthathewas their chief. Thedescendants ofCoyote spread over
thecountry, andoccupied many parts thatwere notformerly inhab-
ited. Atonetime they allspoke thesame language. Itwas like
Shuswap. Some ofthemwerebadpeople, butmost ofthemweregood.
Some ofthem settled intheThompson Valley andinthesurrounding

country. Atalater dateOld-One separated thegood people from
thebad.Hetransformed allthebadones into coyotes. Thegood
onesheledforth, andmade them settle atdifferent places, widely
apart. Afterwards, when thepeople met, theyspoke different lan-
guages. For thisreason coyotes abound intheregion inhabited by
Old-Coyote's descendants, andinthecountry overwhich hetravelled,
butnowhere else.
(28)COYOTE ANDTHEFLOOD.
Coyote was living somewhere intheinterior. Hewasachiefand
father ofthepeople. Nooneknows whence hecame. Forsome reason
aflood came, andcovered thewhole country except thetops ofthe
highest mountains. Some saythefloodcame toputoutagreat fire
which raged intheworld. Others say itwasmade toclean theearth.
Many people andanimals were drowned. Some fled tothehigh
mountains, buttheflood rose sorapidly thattheywere overtaken.
Some reached thetopsandwere saved. Some drifted about onlogs.
Nooneknewhow tomake canoes. Only Coyote made acanoe of
horse-tails orgrass. Heandsome ofhisfriends embarked init.
They drifted formany days, andatlaststruck amountain onthe
south sideoftheThompson River, called Zoke'ski.^ Theflood receded
rapidly. Coyote descended totheThompson River, and foratime
tookuphisabode there. Onleaving hiscanoe, hetransformed it
into stone. Itmay stillbeseennear thetopofthemountain. Itis
about thirty feet long,andthere were figures ofthree persons init.
Itissaidthatsome ofthesehavenowdisappeared. Thewater-marks
ofthis floodmaybeseenonsome parts ofthemountains. Owing
totheflood, water and fisharenowfound allover themountains.
Before theflood thecountry wasdry,andthere werenolakes above
thelevel ofthelowvalleys. The survivors oftheflood aretheances-
tors ofthevarious tribes. Some ofthepeople from Coyote's canoe
settled hereandthere,—atLytton, atNicola, andother places.
2.Sesulia'n andSeku'lia.2
{From Spences Bridge.)

Two Transformers, Sesulia'n andSeku'lia, camedown theFraser
River from theShuswap country. They weregoodmen,andtaught
thepeople many arts. They transformed thosewhowere proud,

They reached Styne Creek^atdusk.Anumber ofpeople were living
inanunderground lodge justnorth ofthecreek, andtheirdogsbegan
tohowl^when theTransformers approached. Amanwent outto
seewhowascoming. When hesawtheTransformers, hemade fun
ofthem. Therefore theytransformed him, thehouse, andthepeople
intostone.
When leaving thisplace, Sesulia'n leftthemark ofhisright footon
astone, andalittle farther down theriver Seku'lia leftthemark ofhis
leftfoot. Both these impressions ofhuman feetmay stillbeseen in
thewoods nearStyne.^
TheTransformers taught people howtomake toolsandimplements.
They carried patterns drawn onhide ofevery object thatpeople use.
They taught people how tomake fire-drills, how tocook,how towork
stone, flakearrow-heads andspears, how tomake knives andharpoons.
When they reached theFraser Canyon, nearSpuzzum, theysaw
thattheriverwas fullofsalmon, which were ascending thestream.
Across theriver theysawaman trying tocatch salmon. Hehada
longrope ofcedar-bark fastened around thewaist ofaboywhom he
lowered down over the clifftotheriver, where theboytried tocatch
thesalmon with hishands. They watched, andsawthathewas
unable tocatch any. After awhile theman pulled theboyup,and
thetwosatdown ontheground torest. Themanthought,"Ifonly
somebody would teach ushow tocatch these fish!Thenweshould
have plenty toeat." TheTransformers helduptheirhands above
their heads, thepalms turned towards theman,andatonce hesaw
them andunderstood them. One oftheTransformers heldupa
pattern, andatonce themanunderstood itandcopied it. Itrepre-
sented bark twine, andheatoncemadesome twine. Then theTrans-
former heldupanother pattern, andthemanunderstood it.Hemade
abag-net. TheTransformer heldupanother pattern, andtheman
knew atoncehow tomake thehoop forhisdip-net. When thenet
was finished, hewondered what hewas todowith it.TheTrans-
former showed himhow tocatch salmon andhow tocook and
cure it.'*
TheTransformers went ontotheboundary oftheLower Fraser
tribe, andreturned uptheriver totheThompson tribe. Later on
they leftthecountry anddisappeared. Itissaidthatthey travelled

3.Qwa'qtqwetl andKokwe'la.
{From theUpper andLower Thompson Indians.)
The story begins with thetale oftheBlack andGrizzly Bears.
TheFisher wasthehusband oftheBearwomen, andthey alllived in
Botani Valley. After killing theGrizzly cubs, theBlack Bearcubs
escaped toLytton, andweretaken across bytheirgrandfather Kwone'-
kwa2tothewest sideofFraser River. Thesturgeon tookthelastbite
outofthepursuing Grizzly Bear. TheBlack Bearcubs disappeared,
andaresupposed tohavegone totheLillooet country. Afterwards
they attained magical powers andtravelled allover theworld. They
became known as"theQwa'qtqwEtl^ brothers" (from thename ofthe
youngest one), instead of"the Black Bear children." Qwa'qtqwEtl,
theyoungest one,wasalways carried byhisbrothers ontheir backs;
according toothers, inabasket.* Theymusthavegonedown from the
Lillooet country tothecoastbyway oftheLower Fraser River; for
theycame intotheThompson country from thecoast, andtravelled
upriver.^
Atthistime there lived intheThompson country aman generally
called"Kokwe'la," or"Kokwe'la's son."^HewasalsoaTransformer,
endowed with magic. Like theQwa'qtqwEtl, heoriginated inthe
interior. Hewasanative ofBotani Valley. Hewasangry athis
mother because shehadnottoldhimtrulywho hisfather was. After
hehadquestioned invain trees, stones, andwater, abird toldhim.
Then hequestioned thekokwe' la-root, which confirmed what the
birdhad said. Asawarning toliars, hetransformed hismother
intoastone, whichmaybeseennearLytton. Hesaid,"Henceforth
women may nothave intercourse with roots, norbear children to
them." Helefthiscountry, and, after travelling eastward andnorth-
wardamong theShuswap andother tribes, hecamedown theFraser

across theFraser andThompson Rivers. He iscalled "the grandfather ofthe 'real

canoes. Bysome Indians heisconsidered asanhistoric rather than amythological
personage.—SeeJE8:318.

success. Healsotried hispowers invainonQwa'qtqwEti. Then they
said tooneanother, "We areofequal power; letuscamp together!"
Their camping-place may stillbeseen intheshape ofalarge flatrock.
Since hehadnowater, Kokwe'la drove hisstaff intotheground; and
when hewithdrew it,water came out,andruns until thisday. Each
ofthefourmen carried diminutive kettles ofbasketry forcooking, a
small pack offood, andvery small spoons ofsheep's-horn. Allof
these became largewhenever they desired tousethem. Their food
was inexhaustible.
(Here follows theincident ofthesoup, asrelated inaprevious
publication.^) Qwa'qtqwEtl saidtohisbrothers, "Watch mefinishing
hissoup atonespoonful." When hefailed, Kokwe'la scraped the
soupupwithonesweep ofhisthumb, and leftthebasket completely
empty.
Before they parted, Qwa'qtqwEtl andKokwe'la agreed thatthey
would travel inopposite directions totheends oftheearth. Kokwe'la
thendescended theEraser River andreached thewestendoftheearth
atsome place near theocean. There hesatdown anddisappeared.
Heassumed thename SEsuwElia'n,^ and willremain inthewest until
thetimecomes forthedead toreturn, when hewillre-appear with
Coyote andactasachiefandjudge.
Qwa'qtqwEtl and hisbrothers travelled uptheThompson River,
andcontinued their journey eastwards until theyreached theendof
theland inthat direction, near theother ocean. Theyoungest
brother said totheelder ones,"Ourwork isdone,now Ishall trans-
form you." They went hunting abearupinthesky;andhetrans-
formed them, their dog,andthebear intothegroup ofstarsknown
astheGrizzly Bear.* Then heassumed thename CEkwo'liatc,^ and
took hisposition attheeastendoftheearth. Healso willreturn
toactaschief, judge, andtransformer when theearth issufficiently

Hisbrothers were only slightly gifted with magic, and travelled
withhimrather ashelpers andcompanions. Ontheirwayupthe

genital organs, and thus killed them. Qwa'qtqwEtl saidhewould
overcome her. Hisbrother tried todissuade him, saying, "You

hisarrow-flaker crosswise inhervagina, andthusprevented theparts
from closing. Hetransformed herintoarock, saying, "Henceforth
noprivates ofwomen shallhave thepower todestroy men." This
rock isthere yet.-
Asecond transformation occurred ataplace called "Gaping" or
"Open- Mouth," near Drynoch. Here lived ahuge horse^ which
caught people with itsmouth. Itplaced itsopenmouth onthe trail,
andpeople walked in. Itclosed it,andthey could notget out.'*
Qwa'qtqwEtl placed hisarrow-flaker^onendinthecreature's mouth,
sothat itcould notbeclosed. After hehadthus killed itspower, he
transformed itintoastone, which may stillbeseen atthat place.
Hesaid, "Henceforth horses shall notswallow people, butshall be
their friends, andbeusedbyman."
Athird transformation took place nearMud Slide. (Here follows

Then they proceeded uptheBonaparte River. Somewhere near
Cache Creek, onanopen flat,grew alarge treewithspreading branches.
Ithadaniceodor,and itsshade was cool. Thismystery treecaused

8.TheHot-Wind People andtheCold-Wind People.^
TheChinook-Wind people lived inthesouth, inthetimbered
mountains. TheCold-Wind people lived inthenorth, inthebare,
snowy mountains. Between them lived theIndians, whohadno
power over thewinds. TheChinook- Wind people were friendly with
theIndians, and travelled among them. TheCold-Wind people
never visited them. Therefore therewasvery little cold intheIndian
country. TheChinook- Wind's sonwent north, andmarried adaugh-
teroftheCold-Wind people, andintroduced coldbybringing her
back tohishome. Theannual visits ofherpeople toseeherbrought
onthewinter seasons. Before that, theCold-Wind chief nevercame
outofhishouse. Healways remained inside. Therefore therewas
noseverely coldweather. AlltheCold-Wind people remained in
theirowncountry. Their houses weremade ofice.Onlywhen they
walked about outside did itbecome cold.When theyopened the
doors oftheir houses, coldwinds blew out,and itbecame somewhat
cold. They never kept their doors open forvery long. Thus itwas
long ago,before theChinook-Wind's sonmarried.

Some sayhewastheSun. Sheweptmuch, because shesaidshewas
about toleave herchildren andliveinastrange country. Shewanted
tomake provision forherchildren, andleavethem atoken whereby

roots. Sherepaired toBEta'ni (orBota'ni), andemptied herbasket,
saying, "Henceforth roots willgrow inabundance inthisplace; and
mychildren shall repair here todigthem." Therefore almost all

{From theUpper Thompson andLytton.)
Itwaswinter, andmany people were living inalargeunderground
lodge, andmany others were living innumerous matlodges near by.
Thepeople were losing their food-supplies, butnooneknewwhowas
stealing them. Many children ofallageshadbeen stolen. The
thefts happened every winter when thepeople hadcamped there, and
continued until spring. One night anoldwoman could not sleep.
Sheheard some oneenter thelodge, runaround thehouse, andthen
gouptheladder and vanish. Onthefollowing morning itwas
noticed thatanumber ofthings hadbeen stolen. Thewoman in-
formed thepeople, who inthefollowing night laydown undressed
butarmed. About midnight some onecamedown theladder and
began topickupfoodandother things, which heputintoasack.
They recognized himasBush-Tailed Rat. When hewent out, all
thepeople followed him.Hewent tohishouse, which waslocated
between therocks, andcalled tothedoor, "I'li'qa!" Then itopened.
Heentered with hisload,andcalled "Tla'qi'pa!"^and itshut. Then
amanwho followed closeonhisheelsjumped forward andplaced a
large thunder arrow-head crossways intheentrance, preventing the
shutting ofthedoor.Now thepeople went inanddiscovered their
property and their children thathadbeen lost foryears. Some of
thechildren whohadbeenyoung when theywere taken, werenow
grown up.There were piles ofornaments, clothes, andfood. They
attacked Ratandcrushed him. They threw himoutside among the
rocks. They transformed him,and said,"Henceforth you shallbea
rat,and shall steal onlyalittle atatime. You shall eatrose-berries
and prickly-pears, and rollthem toyour house. You shall gather
sticks, andbuild yourhouseamong rocks. Your excrement shallbe
valuable asmedicine."^
II.Marten andFisher.'
Marten andhiselder brother Fisher lived together inanunderground

Fisher said toMarten, "Ifanybird alights ontopofthehouse-ladder,

people saytheRatpronounced thewords differently; viz., "ile'Eka" and"tleke'Epa."

pronunciation peculiar totheRat.

missed. Hewent outtosearch forhisarrow, andatlastcame to
what seemed theend ofaladder ofanunderground lodge. His
arrow had hit it.Hewentuptoit,andsawtheentrance toalodge.
While hewaspulling outhisarrow, hewaspushed from behind, and
felldown the hole. Red-Headed-Woodpecker, intheshape ofa
woman, descended behind him,andtook herplace near thefoot of
theladder, onthesideofthe fireopposite Marten. Shebuilt alarge
fire.Then shebrought outsome fatfrom theback ofadeer, and
handed itinabark dish toMarten across the fire.Ashewastaking
hold ofit,shecaught hishands, andpulled him facedown intothe
fire,where hewasbadly burned. Shepicked himupandthrewhimout.
Hecrawled back tohislodge, where helaydown onsome matsand
covered himself up. Fisher came home, and said, "xwe'hwe,^ take
downmy staff. Where areyou? Takedownmymeat." Marten
simply repeated Fisher's words. Fisher threw down his staflfand
pack,andentered. Heknew atoncewhathadhappened, andcharged
Marten with disobedience. Marten related what hadhappened.
Then Fisher tried tocure hisbrother. Hetook pieces ofhispack-
strap (orrobe) ofmarten-skin, spitonthem, andcovered those parts
ofMarten's faceandbody fromwhich theskinhad fallen off.He
could notmakehimasgood-looking ashehadbeen before, norcould
hesmooth outtheskin ofhisface. This isthereason ofthepeculiar
appearance ofthemarten ofthepresent day.Onthenextmorning,
while Fisher was still there, Red-Headed-Woodpecker perched on
theladder; andFisher shot hisarrow atit,wounding it.Heshota
second arrow, which hit it,butthebirddidnot fall. Fisher said to
Marten, "That istheway toshoot." Hewentuptogetthebird;
but, assoon ashetouched it,itturned intoexcrements. Fisher left
Marten, andwent toRed-Headed-Woodpecker's lodge. Onentering,
hetookaposition opposite her. Shepassed himsome deer-fat, and
tried topullhimintothe fire;buthejumped over it,knocked down the
woman, fellonher,andtouched herprivates. Then hereturned to
Marten. Hesaid tohim,"Awoman will arrive to-morrow, your
sister-in-law. Youmust treat herwell.Youmust give herofthe
bestfood toeat. Pickoutthebestskins from thepilethatyouhave

Hemoistened theskin,andshemanaged toputonthedress; butsoon
theskin dried andshrunk, sothat shesuffered painand feltvery-
uncomfortable. Shewas crying when Fisher returned. Hewas
angry atMarten, andcompelled himtogiveherclothes made ofthe
best skins. Induetime thewoman boreason,whogrew rapidly.
Fisher warned Marten never toletthewoman goforwater. When
water wasrequired, Marten wastodraw ithimself. OnedayMarten
disregarded hisbrother's command andsentthewoman andherboy
tothewatering-place. When shewasdrawing water, aking-salmon
jumped near by.She said,"What afine-looking fish! Iwish I
hadahusband asgood-looking ashe!" Almost immediately aman
touched herontheshoulder, and said, "Iamthat fish.Youhave
chosen meforyourhusband. Youaremywife,andmustaccompany
me." Hetook heraway, and lefttheboy there. Theboyreturned
tothelodge, andtold hisfather whathadhappened. Fisher scolded
Marten forhisdisobedience, and said,"How can Ifindmywife?"
Hissonreplied,"Ishall findmymother. Ishall search forherevery-
where." Hechanged himself intoafly. Inthisshape hefound his
mother, returned, and told hisfather where shewas. Three times
Fisher andMarten leftthehouse fortherescue ofthewoman; but,
although theyhadchanged theboy's toysoneach occasion, hecried
somuch thattheyhadtoreturn. Thefourth timetheymade atoy
fawn, andgavehimasmallbowandblunt arrows toshoot atit.
This soamused himthathenever cried. After watching him fora
timeandseeing thathedidnotcry,they started off. Inabarkcanoe
they paddled across thelake tothecountry ofthe fisher. Here

Inashort time theboyhadgrown tobeayoung man,andOwlhad

Hehastened home, and felldown dead atthelodge door atthevery

one.Goandtake Ntsaa'.z foryour husband." They intended to
shame her,butshetookthem attheirword, picked upamat,and left
thehouse. When shereturned carrying Ntsaa'.z wrapped upinthe
mat, thepeople laughed, andtheyoung men jeered ather. She
carried him intothehouse, andplaced himonthebestmat. The
people cried, "Don't bringhim inhere, hestinks toomuch!" That
night herrelatives thought toshame her stillmore. They said,
"Let ourson-in-law cutwood forusto-morrow. Givehimahammer
and chisel." Early thefollowing morning theyoung woman went
upthe hills, carrying herhusband wrapped inamat.When she
opened themat, hecame outofhisskin, rantofourdrytreesand
kicked them down. Then hemade thewood cutand split itself,
andassume thedimensions offourshort branches, which thewoman
carried ontopofherpack. When they arrived atthevillage, she
putherhusband down, andthrew thesticks ontheground. They
resumed their original size,andtherewaswood enough to fillfour
underground lodges. Shethrew thewood down into thelodges.

young men said,"The wood wascutbythiswoman herself. She
must have great magic power." Then the girl's father said,"Make
snowshoes forourson-in-law, thathemayhunt to-morrow." Some
menmade snowshoes, andsoon finished them. Theymade afine

Some said inmockery thathehimself musthave used them. Raven

people started tohunt, Ntsaa'.z being carried byhiswife. Allthe
hunters passed them. When theywere outofsight, Ntsaa'.z came
outofhisskin, ranahead ofthem, gathered upallthedeer, drove

from butting therock, andheandCoyote became friends. They
trained themselves.forwar. Coyote sharpened Buffalo's horns,^
andmade horns ofpitch-wood forhimself. They reached theplace
where Buffalo's rival dwelt. Buffalo said,"You seemyrivalandhis
house and hiswives, alsomywives." Hepointed out allofthem.
Hesaid toCoyote, "My rival isvery strong. Ifyouseehimgetting

inthegrass near by,andBuffalo went alone tofight hisrival. Coyote
said,"You needhavenofear. Thehorns Ihavemade foryou will

Wolf-Boy wasan^ancestor oftheThompson Indians. Hewasa
chief's son,and lived with hisgrandmother inacountry beyond a
great lake tothewest orsouth.^ Formerly many people lived there.
Agreat war-party ofstrange people attacked them ;and allthepeople
were destroyed^ except Wolf-Boy and hisgrandmother, whohidina
hole intheground. Wolf-Boy wasvery smallwhen hispeople were
killed. Hisgrandmother reared him,andtaught him allthearts
andknowledge ofhispeople. Shewould say,"Thus your ancestor
did," or"Thus didthosewho arenowdead." Shetaught himhow
tomakebowandarrows, how toshoot andhow tosnare game. Soon
hebecame aproficient hunter andtrapper. Atfirsthekilled only
small animals and birds, and hisgrandmother made robes oftheir
skins; soonhekilled larger game; and finally grizzly bears, elk,and
allkinds oflarge animals.
Onedayheasked hisgrandmother who hisancestors were ofwhom
shealways spoke ;andhow ithappened thatheandshewere theonly
people inthatcountry, while ofeachkind ofanimals therewere plenty.

managed tohide herself andtheboy;andthattheywere thesole
survivors. Thebones oftheir kindred layscattered around. He
asked where these enemies lived, andshetoldhimthattheywereon
theother sideofthelake. Wolf-Boy wanted totakerevenge onthe
enemies whohad killed hispeople, andasked hisgrandmother for
advice. She said,"You must notthink ofthis. Poor child! You .
willbekilled, andthen Ishall beallalone." Hepersisted inhis
determination, andsaid tohisgrandmother, "You mustaccompany
me,grandmother. Youarewise,andcanseethewhole world. You
know where ourenemies live. Icannot accomplish myobject without
you." Wolf-Boy hadtrained himself, under thedirections ofhis
grandmother, after themanner ofhisancestors. Although stilla
mere lad,hehadobtained great magical power, buthadnotrevealed
ittohisgrandmother, who stillconsidered himaninfant. The old
woman toldhim tohollow outalogandmake aplace initforherto
sitin.^This hedid.Hemade itlikeacanoe. She said,"In this
kind ofvessel your ancestors travelled onthewater." Shetoldhim
tomake apaddle andtositinthestern. Theyembarked andcrossed

who toldhim totake hold ofhereyelashes andopen hereyelids.
Although sheappeared tobeblindandkept hereyes closed, shehad
extraordinary powers ofvision, andcould seealongways. Shelooked
around, andpointed outthedirection theyhadtotake. Immediately
thecanoe shotforward tothepoint towhich hervision hadpenetrated.
Whenever Wolf-Boy became tiredanddidnotknow theproper direc-
tion,heinquired ofhisgrandmother, whoalways said, "Openmyeyes,

range ofhervision. Thishappened four times. AtlastWolf-Boy

mydaughters Igiveyou, ifyou willspare us."Then thedown hovered
over therobe, and,descending before thechief, assumed theform ofa
young man. Allthelodges andtheir people were burned, except the
chief's lodge and itsinmates. Wolf-Boy lived with thechief, whose
daughters became hiswives. Four years helived there, andhadfour
children born tohim.- Onedaythechildren asked theirmothers about
theirgreat-grandmother. They wished toseeher.Thewomen asked
their husband ifhehadagrandmother, andheanswered, "Yes."
They said,"Your children crybecause theywant toseeher." Then
hethought ofhisgrandmother, andwondered ifshewere dead. He
proposed togoandseeheratonce. They gathered together much
foodandnecessaries forthejourney, and their loads werevery large
and heavy. Wolf-Boy transformed theloads into small parcels,
which thewomen could carry with ease.^ They found theoldwoman
asleep inthecanoe, andwoke herup.Theyoungwomen said,"She
cannot see." Wolf-Boy toldthem that ifthey lifted uphereyelids,
shecould see.They didso,andsawthatshehadthemost beautiful,
bright, andpiercing eyes. Theyembarked inthecanoe, andproceeded
toreturn toWolf-Boy's country. Theoldwoman toldWolf-Boy to
strike thecanoe.* Assoon ashehaddone so,thecanoe went very
fast. Thishedid;andwhenever hewas indoubt astowhether he
wasgoing right, heopened hisgrandmother's eyes. Thus they
travelled until they reached home. After some timeWolf-Boy and

Thisversion islikethepreceding, butwiththefollowing differences:—
Many people lived atLytton, where theywereattacked bystrangers,
and allkilled except Wolf-Boy and hisgrandmother. Some saythe
people wereburned up.
Wolf-Boy setoutwith hisgrandmother toattack theenemies who
had killed hispeople. They travelled north towhere their enemies
lived. Hedragged hisgrandmother inahollow log.There were
four stages orobstacles ontheway. They came toalarge lake.
Wolf-Boy said tohisgrandmother, "There isnothing butwater ahead
ofus,wecannot proceed." The oldwoman took offherbeltand
whipped thewater. Shethrew herbeltoutover thesurface ofthe
lake,andthus cutthewater. Asshedrew inthebelt, thewater
divided intwowhere the belthadtouched it.Thus Wolf-Boy
dragged hisgrandmother over thedrybottom ofthelake.When
theyhadpassed, thewater closed upbehind them. They came to
other obstacles, andWolf-Boy told hisgrandmother. Sherequested
him toliftuphereyelids, soshecould see.Assoon asshelooked at
theobstacle, itdisappeared. They seemed tohave shotforward at
once toaplace beyond it,orasfarastheoldwoman's glance had

returned toLytton with histwowives, twochildren, hisgrandmother,
andmany goods. Onthewayback theywent inthehollow log,

Oncesome people werecamped onthehillsnearLytton, andamong
them were two girlswhowere fond ofplaying faraway from the
camp. Their father warned them against thegiants, who infested
thecountry. Onedaytheyrambled off,playing asusual, andtwo
giants sawthem. They putthem under their arms, andranoffwith
them totheir house onanisland inalarge river, along distance
away. They treated them kindly, andgavethem plenty ofgame to
eat. First theybrought them grouse, rabbits, andother small game;

butwhen they learned that the girls alsoatedeer, theybrought to
them plenty ofdeer,andthegirlsmademuch buckskin. Thegiants
weremuchamused when theysawhowthegirlscutupthedeer,how
theycooked themeatanddressed theskins. Forfourdays thegirls
were almost overcome bythesmell ofthegiants, butgradually they
became used toit.Forfouryears they lived with thegiants, who
would carry them across theriver todigroots andgather berries
which didnotgrowontheisland. Onesummer thegiants tookthem
alongdistance away, toaplace where huckleberries werevery plenti-
ful.Theyknew thatthegirls liked huckleberries verymuch. They
leftthem togather berries, andsaidtheywould gohunting andcome
back inafewdays totakethem home. The elder sister recognized
theplace asnotmany days 'travel from their people's home, andthey
ranaway. When thegiants returned forthem, theyfound them gone,
andfollowed their tracks. When thegirlssawthattheywereabout
tobeovertaken, they climbed into thetopofalarge spruce-tree,
where theycould notbeseen. They tiedthemselves with theirtump-
lines. The giants, whohad lost their tracks, thought theymust be
inthetree,and tried todiscover them. They walked allaround and
looked up,butcould notseethem. They thought,"Iftheyarethere,
weshall shake them out." They shook thetreemany times, and
pushed andpulled against it;butthetreedidnotbreak, andthegirls
didnot falldown. Therefore thegiants left. After theyhadgone,
thegirlscamedown andranon.Thegiants were looking allaround
fortheir tracks, when atlasttheycame toaplacewhere thegirlshad
passed. They pursued them; andwhen thegirlssawthattheywould
beovertaken, they crawled, onefrom each end, intoalarge hollow
logonaside-hill. They closed theopenings withbranches which they
tied together with their tump-lines. The giants lost their tracks
again, andthought theymight beinthe log.They pulled atthe
branches, buttheydidnotmove. They peered inthrough some small
cracks, butcould notseeanything. They tried torollthelogdown
the hill,toshake outwhatever might beinside, but itwastooheavy.

24.TheDeer.^
{From theUpper Thompson and Lytton.)
There wasamanwhowasagreat deer-hunter. Hewasconstantly-
hunting, andwasvery successful. Hethought continually ofthe
deer,anddreamed ofthem. They were asfriends tohim. Probably
theywere hismanitou. Hehadtwowives, oneofwhom hadborne
himnochildren, while theother onehadborne amale child. One
daywhile hunting, hecame onthefresh tracks ofadoeandfawn,
which hefollowed. They ledtoaknoll onwhich hesawayoung
woman andchild sitting. Thetracks leddirectly tothem. Hewas
surprised, andasked thewoman ifshehadseenanydeer pass. She
answered, "No." Hewalked on,butcould not find the tracks.
Onhisreturn, hesaid tothewoman, "You must have seenthedeer;
thetracks seem todisappear where you are,andthey arevery fresh."
Thewoman laughed, and said,"You need nottrouble yourself about
thetracks. Foralongtime Ihave loved youandlonged foryou. \
Nowyou shallgowithmetomyhouse." They walked ontogether; I
andthehunter could notresist theattraction ofthewoman, norhelp
following her.Ashewent along, hethought,"Itisnotwellthat Iam
j
acting thus.Mywives andmychild areathome awaiting me."j
Thewoman knew histhoughts atonce,andsaid,"You must notworry
orthink thatyouaredoing wrong. You shall bemyhusband, and
you willnever regret it." After thetwohadtravelled alongway,
theyreached ahilly country. Then themansawanentrance which

underground, theyfound themselves inalarge house fullofpeople
whowere just likeIndians. They were ofboth sexesand allages.
They were welldressed inclothes ofdressed skin,andwore deer-skin
robes. Theyseemed tobeveryamiable andhappy. Asthetravellers
entered, some ofthepeople said,"Our daughter hasbrought her
husband." That night thewoman said tothehunter, "You aremy
husband, and willsleep with me.Youmayembrace me,butyou
must nottrytohave intercourse withme.Youmust notdosobefore
therutting-season. Then youmay alsogowithmy sisters. Our
season comes butonceayear,and lastsabout amonth. During the

with hisnew wife.^'

Twoyoung deer, hisbrothers-in-law, ranahead andstood onaknoll.
Presently thehunter sawthem, andkilled both ofthem. Hecutthem
upandcarried them home, leaving nothing buttheir manure. The
chiefhadtoldhiminthemorning tobecareful andnottothrow away
anypart ofthegame. Now thepeople ateandwere glad. They
saved allthebones andputthemaway inoneplace. They said to
thehunter, "Wealways saveevery bone." When thedeerwere eaten,
thebones werewrapped inbundles, andthechief sentaman tothrow
them intothewater. Hecarried thebones ofthetwodeer thatthe
hunter had killed, andofanother onethatthepeople were eating when
thehunter first arrived. Thehunter hadmissed histwo brothers-
in-law, andthought theywereaway hunting. When themanwho
had carried thebones away returned, thetwobrothers-in-law and
another manwere with him. They had allcome tolifewhen their
bones werethrown intothewater.'- Thus these Deer people livedby
hunting and killing each other andthen reviving. Thehunter lived
with hiswifeandherpeople, andhunted whenever meatwasrequired.
Henever failed tokilldeer, forsome oftheyoung deerwerealways
anxious tobekilled forthebenefit ofthepeople.
Atlasttherutting-season came on,andthechief putthebody ofa
large oldbuck onthehunter, andsotransformed him intoabuck.
Hewent outwith hiswifeand felthappy. Some other younger bucks
came andbeathim offandtook hiswife. Hedidnotlikeothers to
have hiswife, therefore hewenthome and feltdowncast. That night
thepeople said,"What isthematter with ourson-in-law, thathe
doesnotspeak?" Some onesaid,"He isdowncast because ayoung
man took hiswife." The chief said,"Do not feelsad.We shall
giveyouornaments to-morrow which willmake youstrong, andthen
nobody cantakeyour wifeaway fromyou." Onthefollowing morn-
ingheputlarge antlers onhim,andgavehimthebody ofabuck in
itsprime. That daythehunter beat off alltherival bucks, and
kept hiswifeand also allher sisters andcousins forhimself. He
hurtmany ofhisbrothers-in-law infighting. TheDeer people had
shamans who healed thewounds ofthose hurt inbattle, andthey
were busy throughout therutting-season. Inthiswaythey acted
until theendoftherut,andthehunter wasthechampion during the
whole season. Induetime hiswifegave birth toason.When the
latter wasgrowing up,shesaid,"Itisnotfairtoyour people thatyou
liveentirely withmypeople. Weshould livewiththem forawhile."

whenever they required food. Heputthebones into thewater,
andthey revived. They travelled along aspeople do;butthewoman
thought thistooslow, therefore they transformed themselves into
deer.Now theywent fast,andsoon reached thecountry where her
husband's people lived. Shesaid toherhusband, "Do notapproach
thepeople atonce, oryouwill die. Foreight daysyoumust prepare
yourself bywashing indecoctions ofherbs." Presently theysawa
young woman some distance away from thelodges. Thehunter
recognized herashissister, showed himself, and called, "O sister!
Ihavecome back, butnoonemustcome nearmeforeight days.
After that Ishall visityou; butyoumust clean your houses, sothat
theremaybeinthem nothing oldandnobadsmell." Thepeople
thought himdead, and hischildless wifehadmarried again. After
thehunter^hadbecome likeother people, heentered hislodge with
hisnewwifeandhisson. Hiswifepulled outthedeer-fat fromunder
herarm,2 andthrew itdown onlongfeast-mats thathadbeenspread
outbythepeople. Itassumed itsproper dimensions andcovered
allthemats. Shedidthesame with thedried meatandthedeer-
skins, which almost filled alodge. Now thepeople hadafeast, and
felthappy andpleased. Thehunter staid with hispeople foracon-
siderable time. Whenever theywanted fresh meat, hegave hisbow
andarrows tohissonandtoldhim tohunt. Theyouth always took
withhim hishalf-brother, thesonofhisfather byhisIndian wife.
They killed deer, forthedeerwere theboy's relatives andwere willing
tobekilled. They threw thebones into thewater, andthedeer
came back tolife.TheDeer-Boy taught hishalf-brother how to
huntandshoot deer,how tohold hisbowandarrows sothathewould
notmiss,how tocutupandpreserve themeat; andheadmonished
himalways tothrow thebones intothewater, sothatthedeermight
revive.
Finally theDeer-Woman said toherhusband, "Wehavebeen here
now foralong time. Letusreturn tomypeople." Sheinvited the
people toaccompany them, butthey saidtheyhadnotasufficient
number ofmoccasins toundertake thelongjourney. Thewoman then
pulled outaparcel ofdressed skins, threw itontheground, and it
became aheap offineskins forshoes. Allthewomen worked night
anddaymaking moccasins, andsoon theywereready tostart. The
firstdayofthejourney thehunter said tohiswife,"Let ussendour
sonout,and Iwillshoot him." Hehunted, andbrought home a
young deer, which thepeople ate.They missed theDeer-Boy, and
wondered where hehadgone. Atnight thehunter threw thebones

her,andwondered where shehadgone. Atnight hethrew thebones
intothewater, andshecame tolife. Shetoldherhusband itwould be
better nottocontinue todothis,because thepeople werebecoming sus-
picious andwould soon discover what theywere doing. She said,
"After this killyour brothers-in-law." Thepeople travelled slowly,
forthere weremany, andthehunter killed deer forthem every day.
Aftermany days they reached theDeer people's house. They were
wellreceived. After atimetheymade uptheirminds toreturn ;and
theDeer-Boy saidhewould return with hishalf-brother's people,
andhunt forthem ontheway, sothattheymight notstarve. He
accompanied them totheir country, andnever returned. Hebecame
anIndian andagreat hunter. From himthepeople learned how to
treat deer.^ Hesaid tothem,"When you killdeer, always seetoit
that thebones arenot lost.Throw them intothewater. Then the
deer willcome toHfe.Ahunter who does this pleases thedeer.
They have affection forhim, arenotafraid ofhim,anddonotkeepout
ofhisway, fortheyknow thatthey willreturn tolifewhenever they

because they arenotreally killed. Ifitisimpossible tothrow the

Awoman whohadgiven birth toadaughter diedwhen thechild
wasonly afewdays old.Thepeople buried themother, and tried
torearthechildbyfeeding it.Thebaby, however, wasnotsatisfied,
and cried. One night, when itwascrying after thepeople hadgone
tobedandthe firehadgone out,themother came intothehouse and
suckled it.Sheremained with ituntil almost daylight, when she
returned tohergrave. Shedidsomany nights, andthepeople won-
dered that thechildwasthriving sowellanddidnotcryduring the
night. They alsonoticed inthemorning that therewasdried milk
around thechild's mouth, andother signs that ithadbeen suckled.
They thought thiswasstrange, andasked twooldwomen towatch.
About midnight thechild cried. Then hermother approached, calling
"Tcuxhwi's.uuu,^ tcEx.u'uu." Thedeadwoman descended theladder,

until neardaybreak. Theoldwomen toldthepeople thatawoman
hadcome inandsuckled thechild, andthey believed thatshewas
itsmother. They made preparations tocapture herwhen she
should come back thenext night. They boiled some medicine, and
hadalarge bucketful ofitready. They toreupsome drycedar-bark,
andheld itinreadiness tomake ablaze atanymoment. They
covered thefirewithashes tokeep italive. They alsohadsplit pitch-
wood ready tostartabig fire. Fourshamans took their places atthe
north, south, east,andwest, ready tohold thewoman. Atmidnight
shecame tothetopoftheladder, andcalled toherchild asbefore,
butshehesitated alongtime before shecame down. Sheseemed to
know thatsomething waswrong. However, when herbaby continued
tocry,sheslowly climbed down theladder. When shereached the
child, thefourshamans seized her,andheldherfast. She(orhersoul)
tried toescape bygoing underground andintheair,buttheshamans
blocked herpassage atevery point. Others lighted abright fire,and
stillothers threw medicine onher.Atlasttheytamed her.Her
struggles ceased, and finally shebecame likeanyotherwoman. She
laydown quietly andsuckled herchild.
Some years after this,when herdaughter wasgrown up,theywent
together tobring foodfrom their cellar. The girlsatdown atthe
entrance, while themother opened the cellar. When shelooked
in,shesawthat itwas fullofmice, which scampered about inevery
direction. While shewaslooking atthemice, shebecame transformed
intoone ofthem, and finally disappeared among them. The girl
satoutside and cried, because hermother hadbecome amouse. The
people tookherhome.

dayasked Holakwo'xa howthepeople haddied. Hereplied thata
war-party had killed them. Theyoung man toldthepeople ofthe
neighboring lodge tobewatchful, forhethought theymight beat-

man,anddeserted thegirl.They carried thebody oftheyouth along.'
After travelling fareastward andcrossing many mountains (including
theRocky Mountains), theycame toaflatprairie withmany lakes.

journey toalocality farther eastorsouth, where therewerelow hills,
meadows, and lakes. Here they settled, asthecountry abounded in
game and birds. Buffalo, antelope, andothergame were plentiful.
Thepeople said tooneanother, "The girlcannever findushere,and
shewillnever findherlover's remains." When thegirlrealized what
hadhappened, shebecame distracted with grief. Shetravelled about
many daysand nights, notknowing what shewasdoing. Atlast,
inadream, shesawthebody ofherbrother onthe islet inthelake.
Inmany dreams shereceived inspiration andadvice. Shebecame
ashaman, andknewwhat thepeople haddoneandwhere theyhad

Alongtimeagothepeople were living inanother country,' neara
large lake,where theywere attacked byenemies. Since they could
notcross thewater,'* theywerehemmed inbytheir enemies, andwere
indanger ofbeing destroyed. Their two chiefs called themen to-
gether foracouncil anddance. One after another theshamans and
theothermendanced andsang, calling uptheirmanitous andsoliciting
aid.Eachmanshowed hispowers, andsomewere able toaccomplish
wonderful deeds. Some could swim inthewater likebeavers and
otters, andmight have crossed thelake; butthey could notconvey
thewhole tribe across thelake. Onthefollowing daytheyexpected
theattack oftheir enemies. Some people went intothesweat-houses
topurify themselves, andprayed; andothers joined inawar-dance,
preparing themselves forbattle. Only thetwo chiefs hadnotyet
shown their powers. They contended with each other. Onehad
power over heat, andtheother over cold.When onechief^called
uphispowers, itbecame sohotthat thepeople took tothewater to
coolthemselves. Stilltheysawnoway ofescape. Then theother
chief^danced andsang, andacoldwindbegan toblow. Thepeople
fled totheir lodges, and lighted fires towarm themselves. That
night icecovered thelake,andatdaybreak thetribe crossed tothe
other side.^ Thepeople wondered, fortheyhadnever seen thelake
covered byicebefore. Then the chief, whose guardian-spirit was
heat, caused ahotwind toblow,andtheicedisappeared, sothat their
enemies could notfollow them.

Yetthepeople thought, "Even hereourenemies may follow us."
Therefore they travelled stillfarther away. Theycamped foratime,
butthelocation wasunsuitable. Four times theymoved, forthey
were dissatisfied with their camps. One place hadaninsufficiency
ofwood, another offish,another ofgame.^ Atlasttheycame toa
country where wood, bark, fish,andgame were plentiful, andthere
theyremained. This place, itissaid,wastheThompson country at

abounded. Dressed skinwascheap and plentiful, andnearly every
onewore skin clothes. Thepeople were numerous, healthy, strong,

mother ofthepeople. These were Indians, andnotanimals. Some
people claim thattheLytton people sprang from these original inhab-
itants. Attheclose ofthemythological period there were fourlodges
atLytton, each representing afamily, orfamily group. These
families intermarried, andfromthem have sprung alltheThompson
people. Cexpe'ntlEm, Tso'sietEn, and other leading chiefs, all
claimed descent from oneormore ofthese families. Incourse of
time these four lodges increased, andsome families broke away and
settled inother places where there were good hunting and fishing.
Thus fromLytton thepeople spread upanddown theFraser River,
anduptheThompson River. Some families migrated from Lytton,
and settled atNEqa'umEn, orThompson, which wasagreat salmon-
fishing place, andwas annually visited bytheOkanagon. The
people ofmany ofthese places sent forth offshoots, afamily ortwo
breaking away andmaking their headquarters atacertain place,
which intimebecame thecentre ofaband. Thus ourcountry was
settled, until atlastourpeople spread down theFraser toSpuzzum,
anduptheFraser toLaFontaine, alsouptheThompson River to
Spences Bridge, andover toNicola andSimilkameen. Atthese
points theycame incontact with other tribes, withwhom they inter-
married. This iswhyourchiefCexpe'ntlEm, intalking tothewhites

considered thechiefandcentral place ofthetribe, andourhead chief
was there. This isalsothereason why theLytton people hadthe

right tohuntanywhere inthecountry ofthetribe. They were called
the"real Ntlak'a'pamux" Other Ntlak'a'pamux were considered
their offspring orchildren, butthey were not realNtlak'a'pamux.
They were allmore orlessmixed with alien blood, andtheydonot
speak thelanguage sopurely astheLytton division. Notlongago
nearly allthefamilies along theThompson River could trace their
descent from afewfamilies atLytton, whowere considered theoriginal
families. Therefore webelieve that itisnotsovery long since the
time ofthefourlodges atLytton, but stillthetime istoogreat for
ustocount it.Perhaps thepeople twoorthree generations agocould
count thetime. Stories used tobetold ofamigration ofThompson
people from theColumbia River toLytton, andalsolaterfromLytton
totheColumbia River. Lately atLytton Iheard anoldman called
Hwi'kwal telloneofthese stories. There are stillsomeThompson-
speaking Indians ontheColumbia River. They speak ourlanguage,
butsome oftheirwords arealittle different from ours. They also
speak theWenatchie dialect (PEskwa'us), which islikeOkanagon.
Ihavenever seenanyofthem, buthave often heard ofthem, andseen
menwhohave seenthem, andoneortwomenwhoclaimed tohave
been attheplace where their remnants now live.Some saythat
longagothey lived attwoormore places near theColumbia River.
Itissaidthatnowonly afeware left,who liveatoneplace, alittle
distance from theColumbia River, Ithink insome part ofthePEskwa'-
uscountry.^
(c)Migration Legend.^
Theoldpeople used totellusthatwehadnotalways lived inthe
Thompson River country. Atonetimevery longagoourancestors
lived inavery distant country, andreached ourpresent country
after aseries ofmigrations extending over agreatmany years. In
thebeginning, ourancestors lived atsome place inland, south, orsouth-
eastfrom here,onthefarsideofagreatbody offresh water. Thiswas
their original home. After atimeastrange andpowerful people came
totheircountry andattacked them. There wasmuch war,andour
people werevanquished bytheenemy. Many were killed, andatlast
1Compaie preceding stories.
*From Chief TedlEnl'tsa. This ptory isprobably ofIndian origin, but itbearssome
resemblance tothewanderings ofthechildren ofIsrael intheWilderness, and their
crossing oftheRed Sea. Italsohasaresemblance totheharassing ofIndian tribes
farther eastbythewhites, andbyeach other, andthegradual pushing oftribes towards
thewest ornorthwest. The belief isgeneral inthetribes that part oftheThompson-
speaking people livetothesouth, somewhere near theColumbia River. The tradition
may refer toearly Salish migrations. Compare alsoNecootimeigh (Ross, 1855), atribe
formerly living atDalles oftheColumbia inOregon (Handbook ofAmerican Indians,
p.50). This isthename applied byalltheinterior Salish tribes totheThompson people,
andseems togivesupport tothepreceding traditions.

ourancestors weresurrounded onallsides. They hadtocross thelake,
orbeexterminated. Inthose days theIndians hadnocanoes, and
Idonotknowhowthey crossed,—whether theyused rafts, orlogs,
ormagic blankets, oramagic belt, orwhether they crossed ontheice.
Ithink theoldpeople hadsomewhat different accounts. Idonot
knowwho their chief was. Itmayhave been Coyote, orSpEtlEmu'-
16x,orsome noted man. Their enemies could notfollow them.
Foralongtime they livedonthisside ofthelake; butatlasttheir
enemies reached them, andthewarwasresumed. They leftatonce,
andtravelled along distance until theyreached thebanks ofalarge
river. Some people think thiswastheColumbia River, butthey
arenotcertain ofthis. Here theyremained along time. Ithink
theywere attacked atthis placebyenemies, but Iamnotsure.
They crossed theriver, andlivedonthisside. Here they staid along
time; buteventually they quarrelled andseparated, onehalf ofthe
people moving north, andtheother halfremaining ormoving inthe
opposite direction, Idonotremember which. Assome relate it,
there were fourstopsandfourmigrations. Thefourth onemusthave
been themoving ofthenorthern division totheThompson River.
They probably continued travelling until they reached Lytton, and
settled there, for itseems that inlater days thetribe spread from
there until allthesettlements belonging toourpeople were occupied.
Recently Iasked some oftheoldest people ofmyband regarding the
story, butnone ofthemknew it.Some ofthem saidtheyhadheard
it.Probably some oftheoldpeople atLytton mayknow the full
version.
AnIndian from Spences Bridge, whohadheard thestorywhen
young andhadoften heard mention ofit,thought thatthepeople had
crossed thelakeonalogwhich Coyote caused togrow across thewater,
inthesameway ashemade thetreegrowonwhich hissonascended
tothesky,andthepeople walked along onitasonabridge.
Inaletter written tomeafewyears agobyaSLaxai'ux chief, since
deceased, hestated that hisancestors hadbeen driven away from the
shores ofalarge lake,andhadbeen harassed byenemies, whofollowed
their migrations. Every nowandthen theenemies caught upwith
them, drove them from their villages, andharassed them asbefore.
Hesaid thishadcontinued uptothepresent day,andhecalled the
whites theenemies ofhisrace. Itwasnotclear whether hemeanti
that thewhites were alsotheenemies whohadattacked hisremote d
ancestors, butthatmight beinferred.*

33.TheWoman whobecame aHorse.^
Achiefhadmany horses, andamong them astalHon which his
wifeoften rode. Thewoman andstalHon became enamoured ofeach
other andcohabited. Thewoman grew careless ofherhousehold
duties, andalways wanted tolook after thehorses. When thepeople
moved camp andthehorses werebrought in,itwasnoticed thatthe
stallion made right forthewoman, and sniffed about herasstallions
dowith mares. After thisshewaswatched. When herhusband
learned thetruth, heshot thestallion. Thewoman cried, andwould
notgotobed. Atdaybreak shewasgone, nooneknew where.
About ayear after this itwasdiscovered thatshehadgone offwith
some wild horses. Onedaywhen thepeople were travelling overa
large open place, theysawaband ofhorses, andthewoman among
them. Shehadpartly changed intoahorse: herpubic hairhadgrown
solongthat itresembled atail. Shealsohadmuch haironherbody,
andthehair ofherheadhadgrown toresemble ahorse's mane. Her
arms and legshad alsochanged considerably; butherfacewas still
human, andboresome resemblance toheroriginal self.The chief
sentsomeyoung men tochase her. Allthewild horses ranaway;
butshecould notrunsofastasthey,andwasrundown andlassoed.
Shewasbrought intoherhusband's lodge; andthepeople watched
herforsome time trying totame her,butshecontinued toactand

Somewhere intheWhite Man's country therewasapopulous village.
Two brothers belonging tothisplace strayed away playing, anddid
notreturn until late intheevening. Meanwhile athunder-storm
destroyed thevillage andkilled thepeople. When theboys returned,
they found nothing butsmoking ruins. They said toeach other,
"Our parents and relatives have been killed. There isnobody left
here. Letusgoaway!" Aftersome days they arrived inastarving
condition atatown situated inahollow. Thepeople ofthat place

andmeat from thehogs,andcarried ittohisbrother. They ate it.
Onthenextmorning thecooksawachild's tracks around thepig-pen,
andreported tothechiefwhat hehadseen. The latter toldhim to
watch andcapture thechild. Soon after this,hesawboth theboys

brought them before thechief,whoquestioned them. They toldhim
their story. Then thechief told hiscook tolook well after theboys,
and tofeedthem onthebest, forhewould adopt them ashissons.
Hesaid,"Ihavenochildren, andthere arenone inthiscountry. I
want tohave children." Theboys grew fast. They staid there,
andhelped inthehousework. They swept thefloors, carried woodand
water.
Onedaythechief letloose hiseight cows. Then hecalled the
elder boy,took hiseightbayhorses outofthestable, andasked him
tochoose oneforasaddle-horse. They were allexactly alike. The
boychose thebest one,—onethatcould runaround theedge ofthe
earth intwohours. Then hebrought outeight saddles andeight
bridles, andtheboychose correctly thesaddle andbridle belonging

magic. Hesaidtohim,"Mount your horseandlook aftermycattle.
Iwantthem grazed onthat farhillside, where there ismuch grass.
Herdthemandbringthemhome every evening." Theboyfollowed
thetracks ofthecattle until they entered arough piece ofcountry,
hilly, and fullofrocks andtimber. Hefollowed them through it;
andontheother sidehecame toagrassy country with steep open
slopes, andawide road leading upbetween them. Theroadwasas

sweet. Heturned backfrom here;andwhen hereached home, the
cook scolded him fornotbringing back thecows. The chief heard
thecook scolding him,andasked himwhat hadhappened. Then
theboytoldhowhehadfollowed thetracks ofthecattle alltheway,
andhowhehaddiscovered theroad. The chief said,"Very well,
gothere again inthemorning, andtrytofindthecattle." Early in
themorning theboystarted off.Soon hereached theroad,and fol-
lowed along. Atlasthefound himself onthetopofahill,and in
another country. Itwasbeautiful, likethemountain-tops; insome

Hepassed along aside-hill, below ahigh cliff,and,looking up,sawa

There wascoarse goldandnuggets scattered alloverashelf ofthe

Thewhiteman replied, "Kill your horse, andcut itopen. Wild

Then theIndian said,"You have notkeptyour promise. Myhorse

him,andhewalked along the trail. Hesawthesmoke, andfound a
lodge, which heentered. Theoldwoman knew allthathadhappened,
andtreated himkindly. Shehadfoursonswhowent outevery day
andreturned atnight. She said,"When your elder brothers come
home, they willbeglad toseeyou," There werenoother inhabitants
inthatcountry. Hestaid there alongtime,andgained much knowl-
edgefrom hisgrandmother.
After awhile hedidnotgetupfrom hisbed,anddidnotcare to
speak. They asked himwhat ailed him,buthewould not tell.They
questioned himmany times. Atlasttheoldwoman asked him ifhe
was inloveorwanted awife,andheacknowledged thathedid. She
said, "Iwillaskyour elder brothers when theycomehome ifthey
know about anywomen. They govery farover theearth intheir
travels, andmay have seenwomen somewhere." Shequestioned
them; andthey saidthatatthemiddle oftheearth therewerewomen,
buttheywerenotnice. Theonly fine girlswhom theyhadseen lived
attheother endoftheearth. They were thetwodaughters ofthe
Cold, butnoonecould gothereandreturn alive.
Then theyoung man saidthat these were thewomen ofwhom he
was thinking, andthathedesired tomarry theyounger one. His
grandmother, who feared thedangers ofthisundertaking, tried to
induce him tochange hismind. She said,"Choose awifeamong

shesaid, "Iwillhelpyou.When yougetthere, you willbeasked

Ifyou livethrough allthetrials thatyouhave toendure, thestaff will

from themountains, whowerewatching thegold there, and toldthem
totransport theyoung man tothehouse oftheCold, andtogivehim
needful advice. She toldhersons toaccompany them part ofthe

When hewas inside, hesaid tothe girl,"Ihavecome alongway to

Shesaid, "Ichoose you formyhusband. Ifyou willdoexactly asI

Themanwent toCold's house andshook thedoor. Cold told his
wife toopen it.Heasked themanwhat hewanted; andthelatter
answered, "Ihavecome tomarry your younger daughter." Cold
said,"Very well. Ifyoucanaccomplish thetasks that Ishall give

Then Cold said,"You haveperformed allthetasks. Nowyouare

Themother returned, andtoldherhusband what shehadseen. He
said,"They have deceived youagain." Shegave chase; andwhen
about toovertake them, the girlchanged herchild intoapriest", her
husband intoabishop, and herself intoachurch. Hermother came
intothechurch, andasked thebishop iftheyhadseenanyonepass.
Heanswered, "Inever lie. Itellyou,wehave seennoonecome
here. Youcanaskthepriest; healsonever lies." Shereturned,
andreported toherhusband what shehad seen. Hesaid toher,
"They deceive youevery time. Ishall gomyself. Soon they will
reach thecountry oftheHeat people." She said, "Ifyou go,you
will killeverything, even ourdaughter. Everything willfreeze up
where yougo."
After hehadstarted, thegirlsaid,"Now,myfather ispursuing us.
Icandonothing against him.Hewillovertake usand killus.He
isvery cold,andheisangry now." Heat-Man said,"We arenear
thehouse ofmyparents. Letmedealwithyour father!" They
hadbarely reached thehouse, when Cold appeared behind them.
Thenorth wind blewwith snow-storms. Itblew harder andharder,
and itbecame intensely cold. TheHeat people became sick. Heat-
Man pulled outhisstaffandset itupinthelodge, butnevertheless
Coldwas freezing them. Icewasforming around thehouse, and
allwereabout todie.ThenHeat-Man cried tohisfather (orgrand-
father), "We areperishing! Cold iskilling us!" Then theoldman
Heatdrew theChinook windfromabagwhich hecarried attheright
side,andtheairbecame warm. The icemelted, andthepeople re-
vived. Coldsawthathewasbeaten; butheremained, trying towin
thecontest. Hebecame sick. Heat said tohim,"Ihaveovercome
you.You shall never again getangry. You shall return toyour
country and live there. Your daughter shall notgoback." Cold
pleaded, saying, "Ilovemydaughter. May Inotcome once ayear
and seeherforashort time?" Heat chief agreed: therefore Cold
nowcomes onceayear toseehisdaughter, andstays forashort time.
Then itiswinter. Henever grows very angry, and therefore the
winters arenothard. IftheoldchiefHeathadnotgranted thedesire
ofCold tovisit hisdaughter, weshould nowhavenowinter. Heat-
Manhadtold hiswifehowkindandgood hisfriends theHeat people
were,howeverything loved them,howthesalmon andthedeerplayed
inhiscountry, howthebirds sangandeverything wasgreen, howthe

Now shesawthatwhat herhusband hadtoldherwas true,andshe
loved theHeat people andtheir country. Shedidnotwish toreturn
toherpeople. Because Heat-Man hadmarried Cold-Woman andhad
asonbyher, therefore theHeat people's temper was lessened, and

theybecame more moderate. Therefore somewarm winds arenot
ashotasothers, andnone areunbearable. Heat-Man's grandmother
toldhimtokeep thestaff. Hethrew itintotheriver, andsince then
gold hasbeen intherivers. Because goldwasassociated with the
Heat people, therefore, after aChinook wind hasblown, gold ismore
easily seen inthesand, andalong theshores oftheriver. TheHeat
people were liketheIndians. They liked theIndians, livedamong
them, andthey intermarried. TheCold people were different, and
never associated with theIndians. They werebadpeople.
37.Coyote goes Fishing.^
Onetime inwinter. FoxsawCoyote coming, and satdown ona
beaver-hole inthe ice.Coyote asked himwhat hewasdoing. Fox
saidhewas fishing with his tail. Coyote thought hewould liketo
havesome fish,andasked Fox tolethim fish. Foxagreed, andtold
Coyote nottogettired ifthefishdidnotbiteatfirst;hewould cer-
tainly catchmany fishintime. Coyote satdown onthehole,and
Fox left.ThenFox later caused acoldwind tocome, andCoyote's
tailfroze inthehole. Coyote called forhelp,andBeaver cameand
released him. (Others saythatCoyote induced Fox toputhistail
intothehole. Coyote caused acoldwind tocome, asColdwasone
ofhisguardian-spirits, andFoxwasfrozen inthehole.When Fox
discovered thatCoyote hadfooled him,hecalled theChinook Wind,
whowas hisguardian-spirit, andreleased himself. Then hepursued
Coyote, lumps oficerattling onhistail.^Hechased Coyote, whoran
intoahole,andFoxsatdown toclubhimwhen hecame out. Coyote
found that theholehadanother outlet. Then hedefecated, and
ordered hisexcrements totalk, while hemade hisescape. Fox re-
mained sitting bythehole, thinking thatCoyote was stillthere; but
finally theexcrements dried upandceased talking. ThenFoxknew
thatCoyote hadcheated him,andwent away.)

When theyreached thewomen's camp, andfound their scout killed
with root-diggers andscalped bywomen, theywere soangry that
they rantheir spears into hisbody andmangled thecorpse. Then
again theyheard theoldestwoman calling asaperson calls todogs

Coyote wassentbyChief tosettheworld inorder. Chiefsawthat
thepeople werehaving ahardtimeandwere preyed uponbymany
evilbeings. They wereabout tobekilled off. Chief didnotwant
thepeople tobeexterminated, sohesentCoyote tohelpthem. He
endowed himwith great magical power, sothathecould surmount all
obstacles. Hegavehimpower totransform evilbeings, andhegave
himwisdom andcunning. Healsogave toCoyote's excrements the
power tobehisfriends andadvisers. Hetoldhimtotravel allover
theworld andtosetitright. Coyote hadtotravelmuch andtowork
hard. Chief saidthatwhen Coyote's work was finished, hewould
meet him, seehiswork, andthen givehimarest.
(2a)ORIGIN OFTHECOLUMBIA RIVER.^
Coyote was travelling, andheard water dropping. Hesaid, "I
willgoandbeat it."Hesatdown near it,and cried,"Hox-hox-hox-
hox!" inimitation ofwater dripping. Hetried four times, butthe
noise never ceased. Hebecame angry, arose, andkicked theplace
where thewater dropped. The noise ceased. Hethought hehad
beaten it,andlaughed, saying, "Ibeat you.Nomore shallwater
dripthusandmake anoise." Shortly after hehadgone, thewater
began todripasbefore. Hebecame angry, and said,"Did Inotsay
water shall notrunandmake anoise?" Thewater wascoming after
him,andincreased involume asitflowed. Hekeptonrunnmg; but
stillheheard thenoise ofwater, andwasmuch annoyed. Now he
travelled along theedge ofaplateau. There wasnowater there, nor
trees. Helooked down intothecoulee,* buteverywhere itwasdry.
Itwaswarm, andhebecame very thirsty. Heheard thenoise ofwater,

butsawnone. Then helooked againdown intothecoulee, andsaw
asmall creek flowing along thebottom. Itseemed along distance
away. Hewentdown anddrank his fill.Heascended again, buthad
barely reached thetopwhen hebecame thirsty. Heheard more
noise ofwater, and,looking over theedge,sawalarge creek running.
Hewentdown, drank his fill,andascended again, buthadnotreached
thetopwhen hewas thirsty, asbefore. Hethought, "Where can I
drink?" Thewater wasfollowing him.Hewent totheedge ofa
bench andlooked down.Asmall riverwasnowrunning below. He
descended anddrank. Hewondered thatmuch water wasrunning
where there hadbeennone before. Themore hedrank, thesooner
hebecame thirsty again. The fourth timehebecame thirsty hewas
onlyalittlewayfrom thewater. Hewasangry, andturned back
todrink. Thewater hadnow risen toagood-sized river, sothathe
hadnotfartogo.Hesaid,"What maybethematter? Iamalways
thirsty now. There isnouseofmygoing away. Iwillwalk along
theedge ofthewater." Hedidso;butashewas stillthirsty, hesaid,
"Iwillwalk inthewater." Thewater reached uptohisknees.
This didnotsatisfy him;andevery time after drinking, hewalked
deeper, firstuptothewaist, thenuptothearms. Then hesaid,
"Iwillswim, sothatmymouth willbeclose tothewater, and Ican
drink allthetime." Finally hehaddrunk somuch thathelostcon-
sciousness. Thus thewater goteven withCoyote forkicking it;
andthusfrom afewdrops ofwater originated theColumbia River.

The ravens, crows, magpies, andbuzzards came tofeedonhim,
thinking hewasdead. Hegotupandchased them away.^
(3a)INTRODUCTION OFSALMON.^
Now, therewasalarge river,andCoyote floated along init.After
drifting along time, heregained consciousness. When hediscovered
himself inthemiddle ofalarge, swift-running river, hebecame afraid,
andchanged himself intoasmall canoe. Now,awaydown below,
somewhere above theplacewhere Portland isnow,andwhere there is
afallintheriver, there lived thetwoWe'lwel^sisters, whoowned a
weir thatextended across thestream. Below theweir theriverwas
fullofsalmon; while above it,intheinterior, there were none. The
Indians above theweirknew nothing ofsalmon atthat time. They
livedongame, roots, and berries. Coyote, who stillhadtheform of
acanoe bottom up,struck theweirandremained there. Inthemorn-
ingthetwo sisters came outtoclean theweir ofdriftwood which had
floated against it,fortheriverwasvery high. They sawthesmall
canoe bottom up;andtheyounger one said,"Wemust save it. It
willmake afinedish forustoholdoursalmon in."The elder sister
said,"Donottouch it. Ithasbeenmade bysome one. Possibly it
isCoyote." Theyounger sister took ithome andputboiled salmon
into it.Then the sisters went outroot-digging; andwhen they
returned, thesalmon inthedishhaddisappeared, andalsosome of
thefishthattheyhadbeen drying. Theelder sister said,"Itoldyou!"
Theyounger sister became angry, and tried tobreak thedishona
rock. Asshewasabout todoso,thedish inherhands assumed the
shape ofababy, which began tocry.* Shetook pityonit,and said,
"Oh, hewillmake aniceyounger brother forus!"
Coyote grew fast;andwhen thewomen went root-digging, they
tiedhimupinthehouse. When theywereoutofsight, heunfastened
himself, andatetheir rootsand their dried salmon. Ontheir return
hetiedhimself up,andappeared quietandmeek. Thewomen would
say,"How good ouryounger brother is!"
Coyote planned tobreak thewomen's weirand toletthesalmon
passupriver. The fourth day,when theywere outdigging roots,
theroot-digger oftheelder sister broke. Shewassurprised, andsaid,
"There issomething wrong. Myroot-digger should nothave broken.
Itwasmade ofvery strong wood. Letusgohome! Something has

They hastened home.
Meanwhile Coyote hadputasheep's-horn spoon onhisheadand
wasbreaking theweir. Itwasnearly broken when thewomen arrived.
Theelderonesaid,"Itoldyouso!Wehavebeen fooled byCoyote."
They rushed athim,andbeathimover thehead with sticks; buthe
keptonworking faster than ever. Thehorn spoon protected him
from their blows. When theweirwasbroken, heranuptheopposite
bank, andtheking-salmon were ascending theriver ingreat numbers.
The sisters satdown onthebankandwept. They cried,"You have
stolen oursalmon foryourCoyote people! Youpeople ofCoyotes!
You are allCoyote people! You arebadpeople!" Heanswered,
"You thought youhadalittle boy,alittle brother. Youthought
heknew nothing, buthewasgreater than 3^ou!"Then hetransformed
them into birds (sandpipers), saying, "Henceforth you shall be
we'lwel birds, and shallrunbythewater's edge. You shallnolonger
have control oversalmon. Salmon shall henceforth runuptheriver."
Theplacewhere theweirwas isnowafallintheriver.
Coyote walked along theriver-bank, andthesalmon followed him.
Hebecame hungry, andwanted toeatsalmon. Hesaid, "Iwish
theking-salmon tojump ashore!" Aking-salmon jumped out;
but itwasarocky place, andsmooth, andthefishwassoslimy thathe
could nothold it.Thus itslipped back intothewater. Again he
wished; buttheshore was clayey, andthesame happened. The
fourth time thefishjumped onasandy shore, andthere hemanaged
tocatch it.^
Hecooked thesalmon, and, after eating his fill,wrapped therest
upandcarried itonhisback. Ashewent along,^ heasked ayoung
girlateverycamp tomarry him;butthey allrefused. Their mothers
advised them totake him, because Coyote hadplenty ofthenew,
finekind offood. Then Coyote thought, "The Similkameen girls
willhave me.They arerather poor." He leftthesalmon atthe
mouth oftheSimilkameen River, andwentupalone. Hemetthe
people above, andasked oneoftheir daughters inmarriage. Allthe
oldpeople gathered together toconsider hisproposal. Hetoldthem,
"If Imarry agirlhere, Ishall always giveyouplenty ofsalmon."
They asked thegirlsoneafter another, but allrefused himbecause
hewassougly. Theoldpeople didnotliketooffend himbytelling
himwhat thegirls said: sothey said,"Youknow thatsalmon isnot
ourfood. Theback ofthehead ofthemountain-ram isourfood.
Weareafraid ofstrange food." Coyote said,"Very well,you shall
have plenty ofthat, sheep shall benumerous here, butsalmon you

your salmon."
Hereturned, andmade small, poor fish,such assuckers, torunup
theSimilkameen River. Hesaid,"Nosalmon shallrunupthisriver."
Sohemade abarrier toprevent them from passing. Then heledthe
salmon uptheOkanagon River tothe falls. Above thisplace heasked
tomarry amaiden, butthepeople didnotwant him: sohemade a
rock barrier there atthe falls, that thesalmon should notascend to
thepeople above. Hereturned tothemouth oftheOkanagon River,
andascended theColumbia. Thesalmon followed wherever hewent.
Hecame toaplace called Kali'tcamen. Here alltheoldpeople
wanted tomarry their daughters tohim.Hewasglad,andmade a
finesalmon-fishing placebycontracting theriver sothat therocks
almost met inthemiddle. Hesmoothed and flattened thetops of
therocks, sothat thechildren could play there. Healsomade a
salmon-weir. When hehad finished, helearned that thegirlswould
nothave him. Then hebecame angry, andkicked theweir, sothat
itbroke anddrifted downstream. Then hethought, "The girlalone
isbad. Itisnottheoldpeople's fault. They weregood tome."
Sohelefttheplace ashehadmade it,andpeople have always been
able tocapture salmon there.
Then hewentupNespe'lim Creek. Here thesame happened as
before. The people accepted him,and the girlrefused him.He
hadpityontheoldpeople, and said,"They weregood tome. There
shallalways besome salmon here." His littledaughter waswalking
withhimatthisplace, andhetransformed herintoastone.
Then hewent toSpoke'in. Ataplace called Hi'tcox thesame
happened. Hemade acanyon, saying, "The girlwasbad; butthe
oldpeople were kind,andthought much ofme. People shallalways
getsalmon hereduring part ofthesummer."
Then hewent toSnuxami'na.^ Here heasked asalmon tojump
ashore. After cooking itandeating half, hethrew therestintothe
river. Itwastransformed intoarockwhich looks liketheside ofa
king-salmon. There areother rocks there which weremade from
scraps ofthesalmon.
Coyote went on,andcame toSki'tco, where thetown ofSpokane
now is.Here hefound abarrier across thestream, andbegan todig
itaway. Hehaddugalarge hole,when hethought, "Perhaps the
people above arebadand willnotgivemeawife.Why should I
favor them?" Hewent thereandsawthepeople who refused him.

Hereturned toaplace called Tqemi'p. Hewashungry, andasked
asalmon tojump ashore.^ Aking-salmon didso;andafter catching
andcooking it,andeating his fill,hethrew theleavings intothewater.
Thepieces ofsalmon became rocks, which form acircle atthisplace,
andmake aneddy. Hesaid, "Henceforth people shall find king-
salmon dead atthisplace. Some salmon ofthe firstrunwillalways
diehere."
HelefttheSpokane River, andjourneyed uptheColumbia until
hereached Colville. Here astream enters theColumbia, across
which thepeople hadaweir forcatching fish.The latter werevery
small. Thepeople expected Coyote tocome, andhadordered two
oftheir daughters tomarry him. They said,"He hasmuch fine
food,which willdousgood.Weshall getfinelarge fish ifyoutake
him." They were theWolverene people. Coyote hadheard what
they thought, sohehurried there assoon ashearrived. The old
people methim,and said,"Come inand sitbetween your wives!"
Theymaderoom forhim,andhesatdown between thegirls,whothus
accepted himastheirhusband. Thepeople said,"We arevery poor,
andhavenogood fishtoofferyou." Coyote excused himself, saying
hemust defecate, andwent outside. Hewent tothesalmon, and
caught twoking-salmon, which heputintoWolverene's fish-trap or
weir. The next morning, when Wolverene went tolook atthe
weir, hefound them, andwasvery glad. Each morning more king-
salmon were inWolverene's weir. The people wondered. They
considered Coyote agreat man, andthesalmon finefood. Allthe
people gathered there tofish.Theother people said toWolverene,
"Ifyouhadnotgiven yourdaughters toCoyote, weshould have given
himours." They were lying.
Near thisplace Coyote made adam across theriver, andthere he
showed thepeople themethods offishing with dip-nets and spears.
(3h)COYOTE INTRODUCES SALMON.^
{From Similkameen.)
Coyote came toSimilkameen from theThompson country. He
hadalready introduced salmon intheColumbia, andmany ofthese
fishwere atthat time running uptheSimilkameen River. They
could notgettoitshead waters, however, asthetwowi'lawil sisters
hadaweiracross theriver atZu'tsamEn (Princeton). Coyote stopped
when hecame totheweir,and said,"Here Ifindyou!" The sisters
answered, "Yes, wearesettled here." Helooked over theweir,
andsaidtothem,"You have plenty offood. Iwillstayhereawhile."
The elder sister disliked him, while theyounger oneliked him. The
former said toher sister, "Have nothing todowith him.He is

Coyote, andhewillplay tricks. Perhaps heintends todestroy the
weir thatwehave erected with somuch labor." Coyote wasangry
because theelder sister disliked him :soonedaywhen theywereaway
digging bitter-roots onthe flatsnear by,hecovered hishead witha
spoon ofsheep-horn, andbroke their weir. The elder sister feltthat
something badwashappening, therefore thesisters hastened home.
When they arrived. Coyote hadalmost broken down theweir. They
attacked himwith clubs, andbeathimover thehead tokillhimor
make himstop; buthecontinued todemolish theweir, thepieces of
which soon floated downstream.
Coyote^went offunhurt, andcontinued goingdown along thebank
oftheriver. Hecarried hispenis inabasket. Wherever hesaw
women ontheopposite bank, heasked them iftheywanted any

hesawtwomaidens bathing ontheopposite sideofthestream. He
shouted tothem, "AreyouSmele'qamux?"' They answered, "Yes.
What doyoucarry?" Hesaid, "Soxali'kEn. Doyouwantsome?"
They answered. "No,wedonotwant any." Heasked, "What do
youwant?" They answered, "Koma'pstEn^ ofthe big-horn."'
Coyote wasangry because theyanswered thus. Therefore heshouted,
"Henceforth you shallhave plenty ofsheep, butnosalmon. You
shallwear outyour moccasins andyour horse's feettravelling tobuy
humpback-salmon." Then hewent on;andalittleabove themouth
oftheriver hemade arock barrier across thestream, which prevents
salmon from ascending theSimilkameen River.

Coyote was travelling along theiceoftheriver. Itwaswinter-
time. HesawthetwoSteelhead sisters onthe ice.Hesaid," Iwill
goback, meet them, and foolthem." When they met, theelder
.sister recognized him,and said, "Halloo, Coyote! Where areyou

andjumped over hisbones. Coyote came tolife,satup,andyawned.
Hesaid, "Ijust laydown hereandhadanap." Fox said,"You
weredead along time,and Ihave brought youtolife." Ever since
thattime thispart oftheriver hasbeenagood place forsteelhead-fish,
andtheIndians catch numbers there inthespringtime.
This placebecame oneofthegreat fishing-stations ontheColumbia.
Many people congregated there tofishsalmon. Notmany salmon go

Many ofthepeople above went there tofishorbuysalmon. Coyote
staid there forsome time.

SoononeofCoyote's wives boreadaughter, whowasapretty child,
andwhogrewvery rapidly. Coyote tookafancy toher,andthought,
"Iwillhave herformywife. Iwillfeign sickness." Hepretended
tobesickanddying. Hecalled hisdaughter, andsaid toher,"If
Idie,justleavemeinthelodge here. Leave itstanding, andleave
foodandwater, andeverything justasatpresent, sothat Imayhave
everything withmewhen Idie. Ifyouhearanoise likewater bub-
bling, youmayknow thatmyghost ishereandwillchase you. Now,

with her.Heed your dying father's wish. Ihave agood friend
among theUpper Kutenai. Ifhecomes along andwishes tomarry
you,donotrefuse him."
Hepretended todie,and hisdaughter toldthepeople what hehad
said. Thepeople said,"The wishes ofthedead shall berespected.
Itwould notberight todeny hisrequests." They filled thebaskets

time people have never refused therequests ofthedying astowhat
theywanted buried with them. Thepeople moved some little dis-
tance away. Onedayafewchildren played near Coyote's lodge.
When they returned, they told their parents thattheyhadheard the
sound ofboiling foodwithin thelodge. Their parents scolded them,
saying, "You must notsaythat. Itwasnotthesound ofboiling
youheard, itwasourfriend's ghost." When Coyote saidthat the
noise ofboiling water wasproduced byhisghost, heintended todeceive
thepeople.

theywould be.^The first said, "Ishall beabark canoe," Thenext
one said, "Ishallbecome abuffalo-robe, clothes ofembroidered
buckskin, andblue blankets." The lastonesaid, "Ishallbecome a
head ofvery long, finehair." Coyote putontheclothes andthehead
ofhair,pushed thecanoe intothewater, andembarked. Hepaddled
downstream, andarrived opposite Mouse's house. Here hemade a
longsweep with hispaddle, andturned hiscanoe fortheshore. This
caused aneddy, which isthere atthepresent day. Thechildren at
thehouse sawhim,andcried,"Astranger isapproaching inacanoe!"
Thepeople ranouttolook. They said,"He looks likeaKalispel."
They hailed him,andheanswered, "Mai kolenamal kolen akolskalsi'-
iilk!"^ They didnotunderstand him,and called outMouse, who
knew alllanguages. She said,"Hesayshehascomefrom theUpper
Kutenai toseethehouse inwhich hisfriend died." The people
whispered, "That ishisfriend, theKutenai. Thedead onesaidhe
would come." Themanasked ifCoyote had leftanychildren; and
they said,"One daughter." Heasked toseeher, sotheybrought
herout.Heasked her ifherfather hadtoldheranything, andshe
toldhimwhat hehad said. Hethen toldherthathewastheman of
whom herfather hadspoken. Thepeople then accepted himasthe
girl's husband. They drewupthecanoe, andcarried alltherobes
upthesteep bank, andMouse divided themamong thepeople.
Atnight Coyote laywith the girl. Inthemorning she feltitchy
around thegroins, andonexamining herself found some Coyote-
hair there. That night thepeople danced tocelebrate theoccasion.
They danced inacircle around the fire. Prairie-Chicken talked
while dancing, and nearly mentioned Coyote's name. Again he
almost pronounced Coyote's name, butcorrected himself. Hewas
referring tothestranger whohadmarried their daughter. Coyote
called outtohim,"Be careful! anddonotmention thename ofthe
dead." Most ofthepeople knewnow thathewasCoyote. They
said,"We shalldance three times around the fire.Thefourth time,
when opposite thedoor,weshall allcalloutandrun." They didso;
andwhen opposite thedoor, they allcalled out,"Coyote hasmarried
hisown daughter!" Then they ranoutand scattered. Coyote
became angry, andpursued them with astick, saying, "Itoldyou
nottodothis. Iwillteach youalesson forthis." Hetransformed
them into birds.
Coyote's daughter wasashamed. Sheranout ofthelodge and

said,"Badsalmon shallswarm around herbellyandprivates. Hence-
forthwomen, when ashamed, willcommit suicide byjumping intothe

(5)COYOTE ANDTHEICEPEOPLE.^
Coyote was travelling, andcame near towhere theIcepeople lived.
They killed Indians bymeans ofcoldweather, coldwinds, and ice.
They loved thecold.Many people hadbeen killed bythem.
Coyote determined tokillthem, butdidnotknowhow todo it.
Hedefecated, andasked hisexcrements what heshould do.^They
toldhim,"The three IceorCold people arevery powerful. When
youreach their house, youmust address them asrelatives. Call
theman brother-in-law. When youaddress them, callthehusband
xwexwens-takain, thewifexwixwemkellks, andthedaughter le'luaken."
There wasmuch snow ontheground, andtheweather wasvery
cold. Coyote defecated three times. There were three pieces ofdung.
Heasked the firstonewhat itwould be. Itanswered, "Ishall be
fresh service-berries. The Icepeople give berries totheir daughter."
Thesecond onesaid,"Ishallbeheat ofthesun,which willsoonmelt
theice.When itbegins todrip,sayyourhouse isvery hot;thenopen
your shirtandblowonyour body." The lastone said, "Ishall be
ka'ma."^
When Coyote reached thehouse ofthese people, hewasnearly
frozen. Coyote went inandacted asdirected. The Icepeople said,
"Thismanmust bearelative. Heknows ournames and allwedo.
Besides, nobody evercame inherewithout dying. Hemust beoneof
theIcepeople." Coyote surprised thembycomplaining oftheheat.
Before long theiceofthehouse began tomeltand drip. Coyote
opened hisshirtandblewonhisbody, saying, "What ahothouse
youhave!" The Icepeople danced andsangandblew tomake it
colder, butthehouse continued tomelt. Coyote said, "Icannot
stand theheat." Hewent outside and set firetothedead yellow
pine-needles which, onhisway in,hehad leftatthedoor. Hethrew
theburning needles allover theoutside ofthehouse. Meanwhile
theheat ofthesunwasmelting thehouse from within. Soon itwas
burned. Coldand hiswifewere killed bytheheat. Their daughter
rushed outandescaped. HadCoyote succeeded incatching hertoo,
there would have been nocold oriceintheworld now. Coyote
transformed her, saying, "Henceforth you shall beknown asCold,
butyou shall notbeabletokillpeople, excepting once inawhile an
exhausted hunter."

people with horses pitching tents. Hesaidtohiswife, "Iamashamed
togoamong these people alone." Hedefecated three times, and
asked hisexcrements what todo.^They said,"You arebothering

andanswered atonce. Then heasked themwhat theywould be.
The firstonesaid,"Ishallbeaband oftwenty horses." Thesecond
said, "Ishall befineclothes." The lastsaid, "Ishall beafinehead

said,"Here isagreat chiefcoming tovisit us."Hegavemost ofhis
horses aspresents tothechiefs. Hestopped there three days, and
waswell entertained. Onthethirddayhetold hiswife,"Bevery
careful nottothrow anystones atourhorses." That day hiswife
became angry. Coyote hadtalked angrily and nastily toher.He
wasmounted atthetime. Shestruck hishorse with astone, and
immediately itturned intoexcrement. Hefelldown inthemidst ofit,
andstuck there uptohiswaist. Now thepeople found him out.
They said, "It isCoyote." They struck camp, and lefthim still

tobreak ourspell ofbadluck, sothatwemayprocure game." Coyote
didnotanswer. Forthree days,when hecame backfrom hunting.
Foxrepeated hisrequest. Foxthought, "Coyote willdosomething

andpainted hisface after themanner ofwomen. Then hedressed
himself and leftthehouse without saying aword. Hetravelled about
aimlessly. Atlasthecame tothehouses ofmany people, whose
chiefwasPanther. Coyote asked forPanther's house, andthepeople
pointed itouttohim.Hewent in,andsatdown alongside ofPanther.
Hesaid, "Idonotcome here fornothing, chief.Myfather and
mother sentmehere tomarry you." Panther answered, "Idonot
desire toactcontrary tothepleasure ofyour parents. Iwillnot
decline their offer, iftheyhavechosen meastheir son-in-law."
Night came, andPanther asked Coyote togotobedwith him.
When theywere inbed,Coyote drewaway from him, saying, "Iam
amaiden andhave never known man. Iamafraid andashamed.
Iamalsothinking ofmyparents. Ifyou willgivemeapack offood
totake tomyparents three successive days, Iwillbeyours. Bythat
timemyparents willbesupplied with food, sothat Ishall nothave to
worry about them, and Ishallhavebecome used toyou." Panther
agreed tothis,andonthefollowing morning Coyote carried apack
offood tohisstarving younger brother.
Prairie-Chicken, whowasawise person, was living among these
people. Hesaid totheothers, "Our chief isagreatman, buthehas
made agrave mistake. Hiswife isnotawoman, she isCoyote."
Thiswasthethird day,andCoyote hadreturned from carrying his
third load tohishome. Heknew what Prairie-Chicken had said.
Now, Prairie-Chicken andothers made asweat-house, andinvited
Panther tosweat withthem. They were going totellhimwho his
wife really was,andtheyintended topurify him.When Panther was
inside, andtheywereabout totellhimwho hiswifewas.Coyote ran
about above thesweat-house andhowled likeacoyote. Heshouted,
"You willnever have agood wife. Panther, youbadwarrior, youbad

while Iwas dead." Coyote said,"What killed you?" Buffalo
answered, "Ibecame old,andayounger bull killed me.Myhorns
were dull." Coyote said, "Ifyou willpromise nottohurtme, Iwill
sharpen yourhorns after Ihavehadarest." Buffalo stopped. Coy-
otegathered pitchy roots oftheyellow pine,which havesharp points,
andattached them totheends ofBuffalo's horns. Then hetoldhim
togotoanoldlogandtotoss it.Hesaid,"Goandtrythatoldlog;
and ifyoucan toss itwithout breaking thepoints ofyour horns,
they arestrong enough. Ifthey break, Iwillmake them over."
Buffalo didasdirected, and hishorns stood the test.Hewasvery
glad,andsaid toCoyote,"Iwillbeyour friend. Ihavebeendeada
long time.My snd'q'^,^ whotookmywives, issomewhere around.
Letusgoandfindhim! Iwill killhimandtakeback thewomen, and
willgivesome ofthem toyou." Coyote wasglad,andagreed togo
with him.Ontheplain theyfound Buffalo's enemy surrounded by
aband ofwomen. Buffalo said,"That ishe,andthese are allmy
wives. Hide here,and Iwillgoandfight him. Ifheovercomes me,
youmust runaway, forhewill killyou ifheseesyou. IfIvanquish
him, thencome tome." Buffalo ranforward, andattacked thebull
and torehim intwo. Coyote went toBuffalo, who said, "Friend,
pickoutoneofthesewomen, whichever you like." Coyote replied,
"Pick outafatoneforme.Myhome isfaraway, andshewillget
thinwhile travelling with me."~ Buffalo picked outavery fatone,
and said,"This onewillbeyour wife. Youmust notsleep with her
forthree nights. After thateverything willbewell,andyoumaydo
asyouwish." Coyote started homeward with hisnew wife. The
second night hesaid tohimself, "The time thathenamed istoolong.
Noonesince thebeginning oftheworld hashadawife forthree nights
without sleeping with her." Heseized hiswife,andwould havehad
connection with her,butshebecame invisible andreturned toher
band. Coyote thought shemust havegonehome, sohewent back.
Hefound Buffalo-Bull, andsaid tohim,"My wifedidnothkeme;
thesecond night sheranaway." Hedidnot tellBuffalo thathehad
disobeyed hisorders. Buffalo wasangry, andsaid,"Your wife ishere.
Youdidnottreat herright. Youdidnotdowhat Itoldyou. How-
ever, sinceyouaremyfriend, Iwillgiveherback toyou. Now, you
must remember, three days." Thistimewas sufficient tocross the
mountains. Coyote was going totheUpper Kootenai orPend
d'Oreille country. Heabstained forthree nights; then helaywith
hiswife,andwasglad. Onthesucceeding dayhewashungry. He
looked athiswife,andthought how fatshewas.Hesaid tohimself,

Coyote ranaround the hill,andmethiswifeasshecameupthedefile.
From above heshot hertwice, and killed her.Now, hecutherup,
andfound thatshewasvery fat.Hespread outtheskin,andthought
what afinerobe itwould make. He felt likedefecating, andwent
offsome little distance. Hetried, butcould notdoso.Hetried
hard, andthought hewould burst, butnothing came. He feltof
himself, andnoticed that hisanuswasswollen. Hewasseized with
violent pains, andcould notstand up.Then Magpie came, and
alighted onthecarcass ofthebufifalo-cow. Coyote called Magpie
badnames, buthepaidnoattention. Then Eagle, Buzzard, and
Raven came, and alltheother birds thateatmeat. Wolf came, and
alltheanimals thateatmeat, andthey atethebuffalo-cow. Coyote
could notdefend himself. Heonly called them nasty names. The
birdsandanimals picked thebones clean, andscattered them. Then
Wolverene came, stuck hishead intothepelvic bones, andranaway
withthem. Now, Coyote defecated dung about one-third thelength
ofafinger. Hewasangry athisexcrement, put itonarock,andbeat
itflatwithastick.^ Hesaid,"You havedone this.Youhavemade
melose allthefinemeat." Helooked fortheskinandscraps, butnot
abitwas left.Helooked forbones, butnonewere there. Hefollowed
theanimals' tracks, andfound some bones. Then hemade afire,
andcooked andbroke thebones. Hehadfound hiswife's bladder,
andputthemarrow into it.There was justenough to fill it.He
tied itup,andset itaside tocool off.Helaydown, and said,"Iwill
watch it;andwhen ithascooled off, Iwilleatit."Three orfourtimes
hegotupandlooked atit,but ithadnotcooled offyet.Hesaid,
"Iwillput itintowater." Hetook ittoasmall lake,andput itinto
thewater, but itwould not stiffen. Hesawamuskrat swimming
about. Hesaid toit,"Take hold ofthemouth ofthisbladder, and
swim with ittodeep water, sothat itcools, andthefatsets." He
put hisfootdown suddenly, andscared Muskrat, whoducked his
headunder water. Hethought thiswasgreat fun,and said,"When
hecomes back, Iwillhavesome more fun." When Muskrat re-
turned, hestamped hisfootagain. Muskrat ducked hisheadsudden-
ly,andtorethebladder. Allthemarrow ranout. Coyote raninto
thewater tocatch themarrow with hishands andeat it,buthecaught
only water. Hebecame angry, took astick, andjumped intothe
water topunish Muskrat; butthelatter raninto hishouse, andCoyote
could notcatch him. The foolish Coyote had lostboth hiswifeand
hismeat. Hadhebeen wise,andcarried hiswifehome, therewould
nowbebuffaloes allovertheOkanagon country, andprobably through-
outtheThompson andShuswap countries aswell.

2.Old-One.^
Old-One, orChief, made theearth outofawoman, andsaidshe
would bethemother ofallthepeople. Thus theearth wasoncea
human being, andshe isalive yet;butshehasbeen transformed, and
wecannot seeherinthesamewaywecanseeaperson. Nevertheless
shehas legs,arms, head, heart, flesh, bones, andblood. The soil is
herflesh; thetreesandvegetation areherhair; therocks, herbones;
andthewind isherbreath. She liesspread out,andweliveonher.
Sheshivers andcontracts when cold,andexpands andperspires when
hot.When shemoves, wehave anearthquake. Old-One, after
transforming her,tooksome ofherfleshand rolled itinto balls, as
people dowithmud orclay. These hetransfot:med intothebeings
oftheancient world, whowere people, andyetatthesame time
animals.
These beings hadsome ofthecharacteristics thatanimals havenow,
and insome respects acted likeanimals. Inform, some were like
animals, while others more nearly resembled people. Some could fly
likebirds, andothers couldswim like fishes. Allhadgreater powers,
andweremore cunning, than either animals orpeople. They were

notwellbalanced. Each hadgreat powers incertain ways, butwas
weak andhelpless inother ways. Thus eachwasexceedingly wise in
some things, andexceedingly foolish inothers. They allhadthegift
ofspeech. Asarule,theywere selfish, andtherewasmuch trouble
among them. Some were cannibals, andlivedbyeating oneanother.
Some didthisknowingly, while others did itthrough ignorance. They
knew thattheyhadtolivebyhunting, butdidnotknow which beings
were people, andwhich deer. They thought people were deer,and
preyed onthem.
Some people livedontheearth atthesame time. They had allthe
characteristics that Indians havenow,buttheyweremore ignorant.
Deer alsowereontheearth atthat time,andwere realanimals asnow.^
People hunted them. Theywerenever people orsemi-human ancients,
liketheancestors ofmost animals. Some people saythatmoose and
caribou were alsoanimals, likethedeer; andthat elk,antelope, and
buffalo were alsoanimals, although stories aretoldofthelastthree as
though theywere ancients orsemi-human.
Old-One made each ball ofmud alittle different from theothers,
androlledthem overandover. Heshaped them, andmadethem alive.
The last balls ofmudhemade were almost allalike, and different
fromany ofthepreceding ones. They were formed likeIndians,
andhecalled them men. Heblewonthem, andtheybecame alive.
They were Indians, butwere ignorant, andknew noarts. They were
themost helpless ofallthings created ;andthecannibals andothers
preyed onthem particularly. The people andanimals weremade
maleandfemale, sothattheymight breed. Thus everything living
sprang from theearth; andwhenwelookaround, weseeeverywhere

andsomuch evilprevailed intheworld, that theChief sent hisson
Jesus tosetthings right. After travelling through theworld asa

andhereturned tothesky. After hehadreturned, theChief looked
over theworld, andsawthat things hadnotchanged much forthe
better. Jesus hadonly setright averyfewthings. Hehaddone
more talking thananything else. Here thenarrator tried toexplain
thatJesus worked only forthepeople's spiritual benefit; thathehad
tried toinduce them tobegood, andtaught them topray totheChief.

Stillothers think hewasakind ofdeity orchief, orhelper oftheChief,
before hecame toearth. Intheopinion ofsome Indians, Coyote
acted withapurpose, andknew thathehadbeen senttofulfilamission.
Others think hedidnotknow, butthat hisactions wereprompted
bysome other power, andthathedidnottransform themonsters
orperform other acts forthepurpose ofbenefiting mankind. Allagree
thathewasselected forthemission heperformed ;butwhether hewas
living intheskywhen selected, orontheearth, orelsewhere, isnot
certain.)
Coyote then travelled ontheearth, anddidmany wonderful things.
Hedestroyed thepowers ofallthemonsters andevilbeings thatpreyed
onthepeople. Hetransformed thegood ancients into Indians, and
divided them intogroups orpairs, andsettled them indifferent places;
fortheChief desired theearth tobeinhabited everywhere, andnot
only inafewplaces. Hegave each people adifferent name anda
different language. These pairswere theancestors ofallthepresent
Indian tribes; andthat iswhy there aresomany Indian tribes and
languages now,andwhyIndians live alloverthecountry. Hetaught
thepeople how toeat,how towear clothes, make houses, hunt, fish,
etc. Coyote didagreat deal ofgood, buthedidnotfinish everything
properly. Sometimes hemade mistakes; andalthough hewaswise
andpowerful, hedidmany foolish things. Hewastoofond ofplaying
tricks forhisownamusement. Hewas alsooften selfish, boastful,
and vain. Hesometimes overreached himself, andoccasionally was
duped bypersons whom heintended todupe. Hewas ugly, and
women generally didnotlikehim.Heoften usedcunning togain his
ends. Hewasimmortal, anddidnotdieaswedie.
Coyote haddone nearly everything hecould think of,andwas
travelling from place toplace tolearn ofother things thatremained
tobedone. Chief looked over theearth, andsaid,"Coyote hasnow
done almost everything thatheiscapable ofdoing. Iwill relieve
him." Chiefcamedown, andtravelled intheshape ofapoor oldman.^

HemetCoyote, who said tohim,"IamCoyote. Who areyou?"
Chief answered, "IamChief oftheearth. Itwas Iwhosentyouto
settheworld right." Coyote said,"No,younever sentme. Idon't
know you. IfyouareChief, take that lakeandplace ityonder."
Chief said,"No. Ifyouarethewonderful Coyote, letmeseeyoudo
it!" Coyote did it.Chief said, "Place itback again." Coyote
tried, butcould notdoit.Hethought thisstrange. Chief placed it
back. Coyote said,"Now Iknow you areChief." Chief said,
"Your work isfinished. Youhave travelled farandlong,anddone
much good. Now, you shallgotowhere Ihave prepared ahome for
you." Coyote disappeared, andnooneknows where heis.
TheChief prepared toleave also.Hesaid, "Iwillsendmessages
toearthbythesouls ofpeople thatreach me,butwhose time todie
hasnotcome. They willcarry messages toyoufrom time totime;
andwhen their souls feturn totheir bodies, they willrevive, and tell
you their experiences.^ Coyote andmyself willnotbeseen again
until theEarth-Woman isvery old.Thenweshall return toearth,
foritwillrequire anewchange bythat time. Coyote willprecede me
bysome little time;andwhenyouseehim,youwillknow thatthetime
isathand. When Ireturn, allthespirits ofthedead willaccompany
me,and after that there willbenospirit-land. Allthepeople will
live together. Then willtheEarth-Woman revert tohernatural
shape, and liveasamother among herchildren. Then willthings
bemade right, andthere willbemuch happiness."
TheEarth-Woman isnowvery old,andeven herbones (therocks)
arecrumbling away. Therefore thetimecannot befarawaywhen the
earth willbetransformed again, andwhen thespirits ofthedead will
come back. TheChief hassentmessages from time totime. The
Indians have learned from these that tobegood, speak good, pray,and
dance willhasten thereturn ofCoyote, andtherefore theIndians in
many places often danced; andwhen dancing, theyprayed much.
Nowadays theypray differently, according asthepriests have taught
them; andthey build churches, andkneel, praying inthem. They do
notnowdance asthey used todo.The priests saythedancing is
unnecessary, andprayers must beastheChief's sonJesus taught the
whites. Most Indians agree with this,andthink itisthesame thing.
Some think that thewhites mayknow better about this,because it
seems thattheyhave been taught morebytheChief, andmaybe
superior totheIndians inthis respect. The Chief must have sent
many wisemessages tothem.

3.TheCreation.^
(From Similkameen.)
TheChief above made theearth. Itwassmall atfirst,andhelet
itincrease insize.Hecontinued toenlarge it,androlled itoutuntil
itwasvery large. Then hecovered itwithawhite dust,which became
the soil.Hemade three worlds, oneabove another,—theskyworld,
theearthweliveon,andtheunderworld. Allareconnected byapole
ortreewhich passes through themiddle ofeach. Then hecreated
theanimals. Atlasthemade aman,who, however, wasalsoawolf.
From thisman's tailhemade awoman. These were the firstpeople.
They were called"Tai'en "^bytheoldpeople, whoknew thestory well,
andtheywere theancestors ofalltheIndians.^
4.Origin oftheEarth andPeople.
{From Okanagon Lake.)
TheChief (orGod)made seven worlds, ofwhich theearth isthe
central one. There arethree worlds above, andthree below. Maybe
the first priests orwhite people toldusthis,butsome ofusbelieve it
now. When theChiefmade theearth, hestretched itoutwith its
head tothewest, therefore thewest isthehead oftheearth. Heaven,
ortheplace ofthedead, isinthat direction, andthegreat rivers all
flowwestward. West isthedirection thesouls take. Some saythey
follow thecourse thewaters take. Perhaps inthebeginning theearth
wasawoman. Some Indians sayso,andstate thattheChief stretched
herbody across theworld (probably thewater), andthatshelaywith
herfeeteastandherhead west. Hetransformed herintotheearth
weliveon,andhemade the firstIndians outofherflesh(which isthe
soil). Thus the firstIndians weremade byhimfrom balls ofred
earth ormud, and this iswhywearereddish-colored. Other races
weremade from soilofdifferent colors. Afterwards some ofthese
different racesmetatcertain points andintermingled, andthus the
intermediate shades ofcolorhave arisen. Asredearth ismore nearly
related togoldandcopper than other kinds ofearth, therefore the
Indians arenearer togold,and finerthan other races.

5.WarwiththeSkyPeople,^
{From Okanagon Lake.)
Onceuponatimethepeople wanted tomakewarontheSkypeople.^
Grizzly-Bear, whowas chief, called allthepeople together toshoot
arrows atthesky. Each animal andbird shot,but allthearrows fell
short. TheFish, Snakes, andToads also tried. AtlastonlyChickadee
(orWren?) was left,andnooneexpected thathecould hitthesky.
Coyote saidhedidnotneed totry,when hehimself had failed. How-
ever,Chickadee's arrow hitthesky.Theothers allshot inturnagain,
andChickadee shotanarrow which stuck inthenock ofthe firstone.
They keptonshooting until achain ofarrows hadbeenmade which
reached theground. Onthistheyclimbed tothesky. Grizzly-Bear
andBlack-Bear only remained. They quarrelled astowhoshould
climb next. Black-Bear saidGrizzly wastooheavy andwould break
theladder. They chased each other around theladder, and finally
knocked itdown. Meanwhile thepeople whohadreached thesky
hadattacked thepeople there, andhadbeen defeated. They fled;
andwhen the firstonesreached thehole inthesky,theydescended
oneafter another. When they reached halfwaydown, theyfound
thelower part gone, andhesitated todrop sofar.Meanwhile the
people crowded sothickly ontheladder above, that theirweight broke
it,andthey allfelldown. Those leftabove threw themselves down,
and killed orhurt themselves, while theremainder were killedbythe
Sky people. The Fish,whohadnowings, fared worst. Sucker
broke allhisbones.
6.DlRTY-BOY.^
Thepeople ofacertain region were living together inavery large
camp. Their chiefhadtwobeautiful daughters ofmarriageable age.
Many young menhadproposed tothem, but allhadbeen refused.
The chief said,"Whom domydaughters wish tomarry? They have
refused allthemen." Sunand Star,whowere brother and sister,
lived inthesky,andhadseen allthathadhappened. Sunsaid tohis
sister, "The chief's daughters have rejected thesuits ofallourfriends.
Letusgodown andarrange thismatter! Letustrythese girls!"
Theymade clothes, andatnight theydescended toearth. During
thedarkness they erected alodge ontheoutskirts ofthecamp. It
hadtheappearance ofbeing very old,andofbelonging topoor people.
The poles were oldandbadly selected. Thecovering wastattered
andpatched, andmade oftulemats. The floorwasstrewn with old
dried brush andgrass, andthebedswere ofthesame material. Their

Now, thechief resolved tofindhusbands forhisdaughters. He
sentouthisspeaker toannounce that infourdays there would bea

eagerness. Onthethird daythe chief's speaker announced, "To-
morrow morning every oneshall shoot. Each onewillhavetwoshots.
Aneagle willperch onthe talltreeyonder; andwhoever kills itshall

"Ishotthebirdfrom thelodge-door!" andrantopick itup;butthe
oldwoman Starranfaster than he,picked upthebird,andcarried it
tothechief. Sheclaimed hisdaughters forhergrandson. Allthe
people gathered around, andmade funofDirty-Boy. They said,
"He isbedridden. Hedefecates and urinates inhisbed.He is
lousy, sore-eyed, andscabby-faced." The chiefwas loath togive
hisdaughters tosuchaperson. Heknew thatDirty-Boy could not
walk. Therefore hesaid,"To-morrow there shallbeanother contest.
This willbethelastone, Icannot breakmyword. Whoever wins this
time shallhavemydaughters." Heannounced thatonthemorrow
eachmanshould settwotraps forfishers, ananimal very scarce at
theplace where thecamp was located. Ifanyoneshould catch a
fisher onenight, thenhewastostay inthemountains another dayto
catch asecond one. After thathehad tocome back. Those who
caught nothing the firstnight hadtocomehome atonce. Onlytwo
traps were allowed toeachman ;andtwo fishers hadtobecaught,—
onealight one,andonea^dark one,—andbothprime skins. When
allthemenhadgone tothemountains, Sunsaid tohissister, "Grand-
mother, make twotraps forme." Sheanswered, "First getoutof
bed!" However, shehadpityonhim,andmade twodead-falls of
willow sticks. Sheasked himwhere sheshould setthem;^andhesaid,
"One oneach side ofthelodge-door." Onthefollowing morning all
themenreturned bynoon, notoneofthemhadcaught afisher. When
Starwent out,shefound two fine fishers inthetraps. Now thechief
assembled themen tosee ifanyonehadcaught thefishers. Hewas
glad, because heknew thatDirty-Boy could notwalk; andunless he
went tothemountains, hehadnochance tokill fishers. Justthen
theoldgrandmother appeared, dragging thefishers. Shesaid,"Ihear
youasked fortwo fishers; here aretwothatmygrandson caught."
Shehanded them over tohim,andthen left.
Coyote hadboasted that hewould certainly catch the fishers.
When hewentupthemountain, hecarried tentraps instead oftwo.
Hesaid,"Whoever heard ofsetting onlytwotraps? Ishall setten."
Hesetthem all,remained outtwo nights, butgotnothing. Hewas
very angry, and called Dirty-Boy"Defecate-in-Bed "and"Urinate-
in-Bed."
The chief said tohisdaughters, "You mustbecome thewives of
Dirty-Boy. Itried tosaveyoubyhaving twocontests; butsince
Iamagreat chief, Icannot breakmyword. Gonow,andtakeup
yourabode with your husband." They putontheir best clothes
andwent. OnthewaytheyhadtopassRaven's house, andheard
theRavens laughing inside, because thegirlshadtomarry Dirty-Boy.

The elder sister said,"Let usgoinandseewhat they arelaughing
about!" Theyounger onesaid, "No,ourfather toldustogostraight
toourhusband." Theelderonewent in,andsatdown beside Raven's
eldest son. Shebecame hiswife. Like alltheother Ravens, hewas
ugly,andhadabighead; butshethought itbetter tomarry himthan
tobecome thewife ofadirty, sickly boy. Theyounger onewent on,
entered Dirty-Boy's lodge, andsatdownbyhisside. Theoldwoman
asked herwhoshewas,andwhyshehadcome. When theoldwoman
hadbeen told, shesaid,"Your husband issick,andsoonhewill die.
Hestinks toomuch. Youmust notsleepwithhim.Goback toyour
father's lodge every evening; butcome here inthedaytime, andwatch
himandattend him." Now, theRaven family that lived closeby
laughed much attheyounger daughter ofthe chief. They were
angry because shehadnotentered their house andmarried there, as
herelder sister haddone. Tohurt herfeelings, they dressed their
newdaughter-in-law inthefinest clothes they had. Herdresswas
covered with beads, shells, elk's teeth, and quill-work. They gave
hernecklaces, andhermother-in-law gave herafinely polished celt
ofgreen stone (jade) tohang atherbelt. Theyounger sister paidno
attention tothis,butreturned every morning tohelphergrandmother-
in-law togather fire-wood, andtoattend tohersickhusband. For
three days matters remained thisway. Intheevening ofthethird
daySun said tohissister,"We willresume ourtrueforms to-night,
sothatthepeople may seeusto-morrow." That night they trans-
formed themselves. Theoldmatlodgebecame afinenewskin lodge,
surpassing those oftheBlackfeet andother tribes, richly decorated
withornaments, andwithstreamers tiedtothetopandpainted. The
oldbark kettle became abright copper kettle; andnewpretty woven
baskets, andembroidered andpainted bags, were inthehouse. The
oldwoman became afine-looking person oftall figure, with clothes
covered with shining stars. Dirty-Boy became ayoung, handsome
man oflight complexion. Hisclothes were covered with shining
copper. Hishairreached totheground, andshone liketherays of
thesun. Inthemorning thepeople sawthenew lodge, and said,
"Some richchief hasarrived, andhascamped where thepoor people
were. Hehas thrown them out."When thegirlarrived, shewasmuch
surprised toseethetransformation. Shesawawoman inthedoor,
wearing alongskindress covered with starpendants, with bright stars

and sitwithyourhusband!"The girlthenknewwhoshewas.When
sheentered, shesawahandsome man reclining, with hisheadonabeauti-

took thehairswhich thechiefhadsaved, andturned them intogame

cattle,^ andtherefore cattle aremore plentiful thangame atthepresent

foolish.

himthatshehadnotarrived. Herelated what hehadseen;and his
father said,"The Grizzly-Bear hasnotkilled her:hehasmarried her."
Theman could neither sleep nor eat.Atlastthefourth night he
slept, forhewasvery tired. Hiswifeappeared tohim inadream and
said,"The Grizzly hastaken me." She toldhimwhere theBear's
house was. She said,"Every morning atdaybreak hetakesmeto

heisvery fierceandendowed withmagic power. Youmust fixyour
arrows asIdirect you,and sitwhere Itellyou. Ihave prepared a

when Ibring theBear past close totherock, shoothim inthethroat."
Thehunter prepared everything asdirected. Hemade twonew
arrows with detachable foreshafts. Hemade them very carefully,
andputgood stone heads onthem. Hesearched forsnakes, and
anointed theforeshafts ofhisarrows and thepoints. Early inthe
morning hewas attheplace indicated. The Grizzly-Bear's house

AMANhadbeen killed byhisenemies. When histwosonswere
grown up,theydecided totake revenge. Their names were Grizzly-
Bear (Kelauna) and Ketsinsiltin. Their uncle, Mo'lski, tookthem in
hiscanoe tothecamp oftheir enemies. Theyoung men hidtheir
bowsandpoisoned arrows atthebank oftheriver. Atmidnight their
uncle gavethem theirweapons, andthey stole intothetent oftheman
whohad killed their father. They hithim intheforehead, thechest,
andtheback, andmade their escape. When theyoung menwere
attacked bythefriends ofthepersonwhom theyhad killed, Grizzly-
Bearwas hitintheforehead withawhite arrow. Hewascared for

killed alltheenemies except one,whowassentback totellthetale.
2.Left-Arm.^
Left-Arm (Tcatcl'k5) wastaking asweat-bath, andadense cloud
ofsteam wasescaping through thetopofthelodge. Ashort distance
away some enemies sawthecloud ofsteam, andsurmised that Left-
Armwastaking hisbath. They stoleuptohishome and killed his
parents. His sister was carried away captive. Left-Arm and his
brothers, whohadbeen outhunting, followed theenemies, andover-
took thewar-party while theywere sitting around acamp-fire. The
youngwoman was inthecentre ofthecircle.
Left-Arm hadchanged himself and hisbrothers intothree wolves.
Their bows andarrows hadbecome wolf-tails. They howled; and
their sister, who recognized their voices, replied bysinging. This
made hercaptors suspicious, andtheymoved on,allthetimewatching
herclosely. Thewolves followed them northward until theenemies
camped again. They covered the girlwith abuffalo robe.
Finally thebrothers lostthetrail oftheenemies, andresumed human
form. Oneofthem putonhisgrizzly-bear cape,andwasthusenabled
toscent the trail. Soon theycame insight ofthecamp.
Theenemies were asleep, andhad piled theirweapons together.
Before dawn thebrothers stole intothecamp, selected weapons, and
threw theothers into the river. Then they attacked theenemies,
and killed them with theirown spears. The oldest brother (not
Left-Arm) took thewoman andescaped with heracross theriver.

When thefightwas over, allbutonemanwas killed. Hewas

whohadcrossed theriver. Left-Arm jumped intdthewater toswim

Icanturn intoafrog,andthewater willnothurtme." Hedidso,
andremained inthewater, calling forhisbrothers. They heard him,
brought thecanoe, andtookhim in.
Later onLeft-Arm fellinlovewith amaiden named Ring-around-
the-Ankle (Kinpa'tcintEn). Shewascarried away byenemies from
theColumbia River country toaplace near Kettle Falls. Left-Arm
setouttosearch forher,andwandered about along time. Heowned
abonecharm covered with rattlesnake-poison. Instead ofcarrying
itonhisperson, hehadembedded itunder theneck-skin ofhiswolf-
dog. Therefore hisluck turned.
Ring-around-the-Ankle carved arock near the falls sothat itre-
sembled acanoe. Finally Left-Arm found herand tried toescape
with her. However, theywereovertaken andcaptured.
Left-Arm wasbound hand and foot,andbeaten with switches of
theservice-bush. They were kept prisoners forfiveyears. Finally
theysucceeded inmaking their escape. They livedonthemountains,
hunting moose andother game.
OnedayLeft-Arm waswounded while hunting, andheknew that
hewasgoing todie.Hetold hiswife totake thewolf-dog andto
return toherpeople. Then hisspirit passed away.
Ring-around-the-Ankle didasLeft-Armhad told her.Thedog
-ranaway andjoined thewolves. As itwas stillcarrying thebone
charm, Ring-around-the-Ankle tried topersuade ittoreturn, but
shedidnotsucceed.

Coyote knew ofthese salmon, andmade uphismind torelease

Coyote went near,andfound anoldmanwarming hisbackbythe fire.
Heoffered tocarry water forhim ifheshould beallowed tolivethere.
Although hewasnotallowed tolivewith theoldman, hewasgiven a

Grasshopper searched forCricket, and, seeing thefresh buffalo-
tracks, hethought that hisbrother must bedead. Hecried aloud,
andCricket heard him.Hecalled tohim tocomedown and eat.
They were enjoying their feast,when theyheard awhining cry. It
wasCoyote, whowasmourning forthebuffalo. "Oh,mybrother is
dead!"hewailed. When helooked overthe cliff,hespoke toCricket,
andtoldhimthatthebuffalo washishalf-brother. Hebegged Grass-
hopper andCricket toallowhim tocarrythem away. Through his
magic power heobtained their consent, andhecarried them onhis
back tothegreen meadow. He leftthem, andreturned tothe
buffalo.
Cricket andGrasshopper were suspicious andflewback. Theymet
Coyote, whowasreturning tothebuffalo. Hewasdispleased tosee
them, andcompelled them togoback. Byhiswill-power hecaused

They lived inanice-lodge, andcould notendure heat ofanykind.
They were jealous ofExtreme-Cold andguarded him well. Byand
byExtreme-Cold became restless and travelled southward. His
mother, Northern-Lights, warned himnottospeak toanyhuman
being. Hewould killevery onehemet. TheIndians weremuch
troubled byhim, ashecame atany season, whenever hewished.
Therefore thegreat chief called acouncil totryandregulate theseason.
Thepeople could notdevise anyway ofreaching thelodge ofCold.
Finally South-Wind (Cha-helt), ashaman ofgreat power, wasselected
toattack him.Hesetout,andsawExtreme-Cold approaching.
Everything perished before him.When hemetSouth-Wind, hetried
toexercise hispower, but itdidnotavail him. Nobody hadever
been able towithstand him. South-Wind heldout hishandand
addressed Cold ashisnephew. Hesaidthathelived inthesouth, and
thatNorthern-Lights was hissister. Heasked theway tohissister's
house. Cold consented totakehim there.
When they reached theice-lodge, Coldwas fullofsteam. They
went in,andSouth-Wind claimed tobethebrother ofNorthern-
Lights. Shesaidshedidnotremember him,andherhusband declared
thattheyhadnorelatives. They lethimstay allnight, andplanned
tofreeze himwhile heslept. Then theCold family went tosleep.
South-Wind gathered pitch-wood andsetitonfire. Itthawed every-
thing around it,andtheCold family perished intheflames. The
shaman broke thepower ofthecold,andthus theseasons were regu-
lated.

7.TheOrigin ofDeath.2
Amanhadtwodaughters andone son. During thematurity

appeared. Badger wasbetting thegoods which hehadtaken away
fromSkunk. Allofasudden Skunk overcame thegamblers byhis
scent, andranaway with thestakes.
9.TheFiveWolves.
Anoldwoman andhergrandson lived nearariver. Thegrandson
wished tocross the river, and called theDeer totakehim across.
Finally anoldbuck allowed him tomount hisback, andcarried him
across. While theywere inthewater, theboycutthethroat ofthe
buck withaflint knifeand killed him.'
Theoldwoman skinned thebuck. Fivewolves took thescent of
themeat, andcame intending tosteal it.Theoldwoman dressed a
piece ofrotten wood inskins, andmade itlook liketheboy. Then she
wished herself, hergrandson, andthemeat tobecarried toaledgeon
theface ofacliff. This cliff ispointed outclose totheOkanagon
River, near Oroville, Wash. When thewolves arrived, theyattacked
thetent,butfound thatwhat they believed wasaboywasonlyrotten
wood. They wereunable toreach theledge. They tried tojump up,
butsoon wearied. Then theybegged forsome ofthemeat. The
grandmother toldtheboytowrap ahotstone insome suet. Hethrew
itdown intothemouth ofoneofthewolves, andthus killed him.
Thus allwere killed except theyoungest. When hecaught thehot
stone, hecould notswallow it,andthefatburned thesides ofhis
mouth. Therefore wolves havedarkmarks atthesideofthemouth.^
Thegrandmother andtheboycontinued toliveontheledge.
Finally theboyhadusedupallhisarrows, andhadnofeathers to
make new ones. Inorder toobtain feathers, hecaused thegolden
eagleandtheeagleSinaken toquarrel bytelling onethattheother one
claimed tobeswifter andstronger than he.Thetwoeagles fought,
andtheboygathered their feathers. Hetold hisgrandmother that
hewould jointhepeople whowere going tomake waronthesky.'
Hewastransformed intoachickadee.
10.TheOrigin ofFire.
Once upon atime itrained until allthe firesonearth were ex-
tinguished. Theanimals held acouncil anddecided tomake war
against theskyinorder tobring back the fire. Inspring thepeople
began, and tried toshoot their arrows uptothesky. Coyote tried
first,butdidnotsucceed. Finally theChickadee succeeded inreach-
ingthesky.Hecontinued toshoot, making achain ofarrows, by

means ofwhich theanimals dimbed up.The lasttoclimb wasthe
Grizzly-Bear, who,onaccount ofhisweight, broke offthearrows, and
could notjointheother animals.^
When theanimals reached thesky,theyfound themselves inavalley
nearalake,where thepeople oftheskywere fishing. Coyote wished
toactasscout, butwascaptured. Then theMuskrat dugholes along
theshore ofthelake,andBeaver andEagle'^setouttoobtain the fire.
Beaver entered oneofthefish-traps andpretended tobedead. They
carried himtothechief's house, where thepeople began toskinhim.
Atthistime theEagle alighted onatreenear thetent.When the
people sawtheEagle, theyranout,andatonceBeaver tookaclam-
shell fullofglowing coalsandranaway. Hejumped intothelake,
andpeople tried tocatch him innets; butthewater wasdrained
through theholesMuskrat hadmade. Theanimals ranback tothe
arrow-chain, which theyfound broken. Then each birdtookaquad-
ruped onitsback, andthey flewdown withthem. OnlyCoyote and
theSucker were leftabove. Coyote tiedapiece ofbuffalo robe to
eachpawandjumped down. Hesaileddown ontheskin,and finally
landed onapine-tree. Onthefollowing morning heshowed offhis
wings, butwasunable totakethem offagain, andwastransformed
intoabat.TheSucker hadtojump down, andwasbroken topieces.
Theanimals fitted hisbones together; and, sincesome were missing,
theyputpine-needles into itstail. Therefore thesucker hasmany
bones.
II.TheEagles.
Bald-Headed Eagle (Pakamiaken) fellinlovewith thewife ofhis
elder brother Hail-Storm (Selusken). OnedayBald-Head found an
eagle's nestbetween Omak Lake andOmak Creek. Heasked his
brother toaccompany himandtogetfeathers forahead-dress. The
brothers made arope, andHail-Storm letdown hiselder brother to
theledge onwhich theeagle's nestwaslocated. There hisbrother
deserted him.Hefound theyoung eagles inthenest,andadead
ground-hog which theoldeagles had leftthere. When themother-
eagle returned, sheattacked theman, who, however, succeeded in
catching herwingandtying her. Three days later themale eagle
appeared, andhetiedhim also. Then hetiedtheyoung eagles tothe
same rope,jumped down, andwascarried down safely bytheeagles.
After hehadreturned, hisfriends killed thetreacherous brother.'

12.ThePoisoned Arrows.^
Anoldwoman warned herdaughter nottogoupabrook when
picking service-berries, because Kelauna, afemale grizzly bear, lived
thereandwould attack her. Since berries grew thickandlarge there,
the girldisobeyed. While shepicked berries, thegrizzly killed her.
Herunborn childwas laidupon arockand leftunharmed.
When theyoungwoman didnotreturn, hergrandmother searched
forherandfound theinfant boy. Shetookhimhome andcared for
him. Shenamed himHesken. When hewasayear old,shetoldhim
ofhismother's death, andalways kept theideaofrevenge before him.
When hewastwelve years old,shewanted totesthiscourage, and
senthimatnight toarock ofsupernatural power, which hewasto
mark withapainting ofhisown design. Thenextdayshewent to
look,andfound thathehaddrawn agrizzly bear's head.
Asummer andwinter passed. Then hewassentacross twomoun-
tain-ranges, across twovalleys, andtoahighpeak. There hebuilta
monument, andremained twelve days without eating orsleeping.
Then hisguardian-spirit came tohim intheform ofabird,andasong
wasgiven tohim.Hebecame very brave. Hewastoldbyavoice
where tofindpoison withwhich totiphisarrows torevenge hismother's
death.
Hereturned tohisgrandmother. She inquired what hehad
learned, butherefused totellheruntil after hehadrevenged his
mother. Shesuspected thathehadobtained power, andsheinstructed
him intheknowledge ofmagical power thatsheherself possessed.
Then shesenthimtoadistant mountain onwhich dwelt inacavea
huge supernatural snake. "When youenter thecave," she said,
"donotbeafraid, although hiseyes shoot forth lightning and his
tongue flame."
Theboywent tothecaveandsawthegreat snake, which laycoiled
inthecentre. TheSnake spoke tohim;andheanswered, "Iamnot
afraid ofyou, foryouarethespirit ofmygrandfather, and Ihave
come toyou forpoison withwhich totipmyarrows toavenge my
mother's death."
TheSnake sawthathehadcourage andknowledge. Hetook a
tooth from hismouth andoffered ittohim. Theboyrefused it. It
wasnotwhat hewanted. Heputhisarmsaround theSnake's neck
andbegged fortherealpoison. Another tooth wasoffered him,but
that alsowasrefused. Hebegged forthedeadliest onetheSnake had.
Then theSnake gavehimafront tooth, saying, "Touched with that
poison, avictim gives onelookanddies."
Hesken returned home, andcutwood forhisbow-stave, andservice-
bushes forhisarrows. Hemade arrows, andcovered the flint tips

with poison taken from thesnake-tooth. Hisgrandmother asked
whyhemade fivearrows when heneeded butone.Herephed that
heneeded five. Sheasked,"Why don't youmake more, then?"
HerepHed, "Ineedbutfive."
Inthespring oftheyearheclimbed amountain, andonthesummit
found adim trailmade byfive sisters. Hedidnotseeany tracks,
andwaited under apine-tree. After awhile heclimbed thetree,but
sawnothing.
Upon descending, hemetanoldwoman named Kimhist, who told
himofawar-dance tobeheldatherhouse. Hebegged tobeallowed
toaccompany her. Sherefused because there were five sisters there
whodidnotlikestrangers. Finally sheconsented tolethimgoalong,
andtoldhimtostand behind herback.
When theystepped intothelodge, therewasaheavy growl. Three
ofthesisters asked iftherewasahuman being near.When thesisters
sawHesken, they tried tofrighten him,butKimhist defended him.
The eldest sister, Kelauna, began achant telling ofherintention to
destroy everyhuman being inthespring. Kimhist toldtheothers
tobring salmon andgiveHesken something toeat.
They gavehimcamas. Hethought, "Camas, that iswhatmy
mother dug; salmon, that iswhatmyfather caught." Hebegan to
grow very angry. Kelauna continued herchant:"Iwill killandtear
topieces everyhuman being Imeet, andscatter hisbody over the
faceoftheearth."
Hesken chanted after her,"Iwill killandteartopieces every grizzly
bear Imeet, andscatter hisbody over thefaceoftheearth."
Thismade thewoman angry, andshewould have attacked him if
Kimhist hadnotbeen there. Before daybreak, while thebears slum-
bered, Hesken stoleoutandreturned tothetree.Heclimbed itand
waited. Atsunrise theeldest sistercame outoftheden. She felt
depressed andsad,andthetears rolled from hereyes. Assheclimbed
thetrailandpassed under thepine-tree, Hesken whistled. Shelooked
up,andhekilled herwithoneofhispoisoned arrows. Then hecame
down, cutoffherfeet,andthrew them tothefourwinds. Hescattered
them sofar,thattheycould notreturn todevour theIndians ofthat
place.
Thenextmorning hersistercame outandclimbed the trail. He
shotherinthesame manner. Onthethirdandfourth dayshekilled
twomore ofthesisters. Onthefifthdaythelastonecame out,but
shedidnotclimb the trail. Sheturned andwent offthrough the
forest. Hesken didnotgoinpursuit. Hedecided nottodestroy
thewhole grizzly-bear race.
Ashedescended themountain, hemetablack bear. Shetoldhim

avenged, Iamwellpleased withyour courage." Then shewentaway.
Hesken went back tohisgrandmother, and toldher allshehad
wished toknow. Shegave agreat feast inhishonor.
13.TheRacebetween Turtle andFrog.^
Atonetime therewasaraceproposed between Turtle andFrog.
Allthepeople betthatFrogwould win. Mud-Turtle asked forthree
days tolethisfriends know about therace. Therace-course was
veryuneven,—lowandhighground, rolling meadow.
Turtle bethisback against Frog's tail.
OnthethirddayTurtle wasgiven head start. Frog stood there
taking more bets. Finally hestarted, andahead inalowplace he
sawTurtle going outofsight. Each time helooked ahead hesaw

over theline.Hehadtogiveuphistail. Ittook sixturtles tobeat

before theycanbecome frogs.
14.TheOrigin oftheDifferent Languages.
Inacertain place inthewinter months, theducks {lulluUo) collected
ingreat numbers. When anyoneapproached them, theywould rise
and flyaway, making awhistling-noise. Onemorning twohunters
wentdown toariver tokillsome ducks. Theyhadeachobtained one,
when adispute arose over thequestion whether thewhistling-noise
wasmade withthebillorwiththewingswhen they rosetofly.Neither
could convince theother, andthewords became bitter. Finally they
agreed totake ittothechief, and lethim settle thedispute.
The chief heard thestory, andlooked attheducks. Both ofthem
were dead andcould notmake any noise. Therefore hecalled a
council tolisten tothedispute. Thepeople came from allaround to
deliberate. They spoke onelanguage andhadonlyonechief.
Theducks were brought in,andthechief explained thequestion.
Thepeople said,"Wedonotwish tobeunjust, wewillgototheriver
andhear forourselves. These ducks candousnogood." Sothey
wentdown totheriverandfrightened theducks which flewover their
heads. Part oftheIndians saidthenoisewasmade with the bills;
part said itwasmade with thewings. They could notagree. There-
foretheducks weremade toflyonce more. Thepeople began to
quarrel violently, andseparated inanuglymood.
Allduring thewinter thefeeling grew, until inspring themutual

hatred drove part oftheIndians south tohunt fornewhomes. This
wasthe firstdivision ofthepeople into tribes. They selected achief
from theirown division, andcalled themselves byanother name.
Finding new objects, andhaving togive such objects names,
brought newwords into their former language; andthus aftermany
years thelanguage waschanged. Each split inthetribemade anew
division andbrought anew chief. Each migration brought different
words andmeanings. Thus thetribes slowly scattered; andthusthe
dialects, andevennewlanguages, were formed.
15.TheWeeping Woman.
Chatalem luredaway hunters byherbeautiful, sadwailing. She
always kept atadistance from them, sothatthey could notseeher.
They followed heruntil they perished.
Onebrave hunter followed thestream toitssource. Then hecamped

thought ofhiswifeandchildren whom hehad leftathome, andtried
toforget her.
Oneday inmid-winter heslept soundly. When heawoke, shewas

{Told byMichel R&uais})
I.Coyote, Wren, andGrouse.
Once Coyote metWren (tsEska'n), andlaughed athissmallbow
and arrows.^ Hesaid,"You can't shoot farwith those." Wren
answered, "Yes, Icanshoot far. Ifyougotothat distant ridge,
Iwillshoot youwhile youarethere." Coyote laughed, and said,
"That ridge issofaraway thatwecanhardly seeit."Soon after-
wards Coyote waswalking along thisridge, andFoxwasfollowing him.
Hehad forgotten about histalkwithWren. Presently heheard
something coming, andWren's arrow struck him intheheart. He
gavetwojumps and felldown dead. Foxpulled outthearrow, and
jumped overCoyote, whocame tolife,and said,"Imusthave slept
along time," Fox said,"You were notsleeping, youwere dead.
Wren's arrow struck your heart. Whydoyou foolwithWren? You
know hecanshoot better thananyone." Coyote tookthearrow from
Fox,and said,"Ishall getevenwithhim."
Some time after this,Coyote metWren, andproposed togamble
with him.Hesaid, "Ihaveanarrow which looks likeyours. Now
youhave achance towin itback." They played agame ofthrowing
arrows. Coyote beatWren every time,andwon allhisarrows. Then
hewon hisbow,and later allhisbeautiful clothes. Wren was left
practically naked. Coyote went offsinging, "Alpano'n eKalispe'"
("Iwonfrom theKalispel"). Wren followed himatsome distance.
Coyote passed bythelodge ofWillow-Grouse,^ whohadtenyoung
children. Their parents were offinthe hills. Coyote asked the
children, "Who isyour father?" They answered, "Toxto'xtu'su"'

They didso,andcrowded around theedge towatch him.Hepushed
them intothehole,andthrew earth andhotashes ontopofthem.
When theywere cooked, hewent on.Their parents came home, and,
finding their children dead, they cried. Wrencame along, andasked
themwhythey cried. They toldhim.Wren said,"Ihaveagrudge
against Coyote, too. Iwantmythings which hewonfrom me. If

2.Coyote andtheSnake-Monster.^
There wasahuge rattlesnake-monster which occupied theJocko
valley. ItstailwasatS.nlpo' (Come-Out orEmerge), aplace near
Evero; and itsmouth, atSkul'io', near Ravalli. Itsstomach wasnear
Jocko. Itswallowed people without theirknowing it.They walked
into itsmouth, andpassed ontoitsstomach, thinking theywere
going through avalley, andnotknowing thattheywere inside amon-
ster.When they reached thestomach, theybecame sick,andere
long died.
Coyote was travelling with Fox,andreached that district. The
people toldhim ofthemonster, andhesaidhewould goand kill it.
Coyote's cousin Fox,^whowas histravelling-companion, advised him
nottogo,because hewould bekilled. Coyote, however, started;
andwhen near themonster's head, hecuttwolong tamarack-poles,
andcarried them along onhisshoulder. Hethought,"Iwillusethese
incasehetries toclose hismouth onme."Hepassed through themon-
ster'smouth without knowing it.When hereached aplace near Arlee,
hesawanumber ofpeople inallstages ofdying. Heasked themwhat
theyweredoing there; andtheyanswered, "The monster haskilled us."
Hesaid,"Where ishe? Iamlooking forhim. Idon't seeanything

sharp arrow-stone fastened upright onhishead. Hebegan todance;
andwhenever hejumped up,thedagger pierced theheart.^ Thus he
keptondancing until hehad killed themonster. Itsheartmay still
beseen intheshape ofButte, near Jocko. Coyote supported its
mouth sothat itcould notclose, andopened itstail.Thecuthemade

forpeople topassthrough without hindrance orharm. When hehad
finished, thevalley wasasweseeitto-day.
3.Coyote andMountain-Sheep.^
Coyote was travelling, andcame toAmtkane', about fivemiles
below Missoula, where alarge rock isstanding ontheedge ofahigh
cliff. Itmoves when itispushed. Here lived theMountain-Ram
who killed people. Heinvited passers-by topush therockover the
cliff.When they failed, heinvited them tolookover the cliffatthe
sheep ontherocks below. Then, while theywere looking, hewould
pushthem over,andthus killthem. AsCoyote waspassing. Bighorn
shouted tohim. Coyote wentupandasked himwhat hewanted.
HesawthatCoyote wasarmed :sohesaid,"You havebowandarrows.
Ishould likeyoutoshoot those sheepamong therocks below." Coy-
otewent tolook atthem. Then Bighorn pushed himover,andhe
was killed ontherocks below. Later Foxcame along, andjumped
overhim. Then Coyote moved, rubbed hiseyes,and said, "Imust
have slept along time." Foxanswered, "You were dead. Itold
younottocome here." Coyote said,"Iwillberevenged." Coyote
went thesameway;andashewaspassing. Bighorn shouted asbefore.
Coyote asked himwhat hewanted. Ram said tohim,"You have
bowandarrows. Iwantyou toshoot these sheep." Coyote went
cautiously totheedge ofthe cliff,andpretended nottoseethesheep.
Bighorn pointed them out,butCoyote saidhedidnotseethem. Ram
leaned outoverthe clifftoshowthem toCoyote, andthelatter shoved
himoverandkilled him.Hesaid,"Hadyoukeptonliving anddoing
thisway,youwould have exterminated thepeople."
4.Coyote andtheSkukula'na Women.^
Coyote was travelling, andwent upBitter-Root River. There
hesawanumber ofwomen dancing among tallgrass onthebank.
Heapproached, crossing aridge. Heheard them singing, "He goes
uptheridge." Hesaid,"They have noticed me.Theymean me."
When hewentdown over theridge, they sang,"He goesdown the
ridge." Coyote thought, "They refer tome." Hewentdown and
joined thewomen. They tookhimbyeach hand, anddanced with

himtowards theriver. They said,"We aregoing intothewater."
Coyote said,"Letmego.Myclothes willgetwet. Iwilltakethem
off." They answered, "You need notmind. Itdoes notmatter
about clothes intheother world where youaregoing." They took
himintothewater, anddragged himupanddown untilhewasdrowned.
They lefthisbodyonthebank; andFoxcame along, andbrought him
tolifebyjumping over him. Coyote said,"Ishall geteven with
thesewomen." Hewent back, andfound them dancing inthesame
place. Hesetfiretothegrass allaround them, andtheyrantogether
togetaway from the fire.When theysawthat itwould reach them,
theyrushed through andranfortheriver. Asthey passed through
the fire,they were scorched. Coyote transformed them, saying,
"You shallbeSkukula'na,^ andpeople shallputyouintothe fireand
eatyou." Forthisreason these shell-fish appear asifburned onone
side.
5.Coyote andElk.^
Coyote went toStsE'ltsaltsEle' (Few-Trees-standing-on-Prairie),
aplace nearHamilton ontheBitter-Root River, where anElk-Monster
lived. Itlayonabutte there, fromwhich itcould seealongdistance
over theadjoining prairie. Nothing could passovertheprairie with-
outbeing seenby it.When itsawpeople, itdrew initsbreath, and
theywere sucked into itsmouth andswallowed. Ithadthus killed
many people.
Coyote took hiswife, theShort-Tailed-Mouse, withhim,andordered
hertodiganunderground passage totheElk. Shebegan towork
behind ahill,andtunnelled uptotheElk.Then herhusband told
hertomovecamp across theprairie. Coyote went through thepas-
sage,andcame outright under theElk-Monster. The latter was
surprised, and said,"How didyoucome here? Inever sawyou. I
seeeverything." Coyote answered, "Icame right across theprairie.
Youmust beblind ifyoudidnotseeme." Elkbecame afraid, for
hethought Coyote musthave greater powers thanhehad. Justthen
Coyote sawthepeople crossing theprairie. Heasked Elk ifhesaw
them, andheanswered, "Yes." Coyote said,"Then goandattack
them. Intheworldwhence Icomewedothat.Whenweseestrangers,
wegoouttoattack themandtrytotake their scalps." Elkagreed,
andCoyote accompanied him. Elkhadalarge stone dagger. Coyote
said,"That knife willmake you tired. Itistoolargeandheavy for
youtocarry. Letmecarry itforyou." Elkgavehimtheknife, and
thusdisarmed himself. Then Coyote attacked him,stabbed him to
death, andcutouthisheart. Hesaid, "Henceforth you shall bea
common elk,andpeople shall eatyou, instead ofyour eating people."

6.TheWren.^
TheEarth people wanted tomakewarontheSkypeople. Grizzly-
Bearwas their chief, andhecalled allthewarriors together. They
were toldtoshoot inturn atthemoon (orsky). Alldidasdirected,
but their arrows fellshort. OnlyWren hadnotshot hisarrow.
Coyote said,"Heneed notshoot. He istoosmall, and hisbowand
arrows aretooweak." However, Grizzly-Bear declared thatWren
must have histurn. Wren shot hisarrow, and ithitthemoon (or
sky)andstuck fast. Then theothers shot their arrows, which stuck
each inthenock ofthepreceding one, until theyhadmade achain
reaching from theskytotheground. Then allthepeople climbed up,
Grizzly-Bear going last.Hewasvery heavy; andwhen hewasup
more than halfway, thechain broke byhisweight. Hemade aspring,
andcaught thepart ofthechain above him;andthiscaused thearrows
topulloutatthetop,where theleading warriors hadmade ahole to
enter thesky.Thewhole chain felldown, and leftthepeople without
means ofdescending. TheEarth people attacked theSkypeople
(i.e., theStars), anddefeated them inthe first battle; butthelatter
soongathered insuchnumbers thatthey faroutnumbered theEarth
people, and inthenext battle routed them, killing agreat many.'^
Thedefeated Earth people ranfortheladder, many being overtaken
and killed ontheway.When they found theladder broken, each
prepared himself thebestwayhecould, soasnottofalltooheavily, and
oneafteranother jumped down. Flying-Squirrel waswearing asmall
robe, which hespread outlikewings when hejumped: therefore he
hassomething likewings now. Hecamedown without hurting him-
self. Whitefish looked down theholebefore jumping. When hesaw
thegreat depth, hepuckered uphismouth anddrew back: therefore he
hasasmall puckered mouth atthepresent day. Sucker jumped down
without firstpreparing himself, and hisbones were broken: therefore
thesucker's bones arefound inallparts ofitsfleshnow.

I.Conditions inMythological Times.
Along timeagoconditions ontheearth were different fromwhat
they arenow,andpeople hadahardtime tolive. There wasmuchwind
andheat,and little rainorsnow. Itwasvery dry.Some saythunder
was frequent, and lightning killedmany people. Many monsters
lived onearth and killed people. Gradually these conditions were
changed byCoyote and others, whomademany transformations
beneficial tothepeople. Coyote alsointroduced thesalmon, made
fishing-places, andtaught thepeople many arts. Giants anddwarfs
ofseveral kinds inhabited some parts ofthecountry, particularly
mountains and forests. Coyote didnottransform allofthem, and
some aresaid toexist atthepresent day. Inthesamewaysome
"mysteries" —both land andwater beings—continue toexist.
Evenmany beings thatCoyote transformed hadnot alltheir evil
powers taken from them, andtheysometimes harm people atthe
present day.
Other informants stated thattheyhadheardmany stories ofgiants,
dwarfs, andlandandwater mysteries. One ofthelastwas called
"The Water-Buffalo. "They hadheard some stories ofOld-One,^ a
greatmany Coyote stories, theArrow-Chain story,2theSnake-Lover
story,^ twostories oftheorigin ofdeath, aFoxstory, anEagle story,
some Star stories, aSunandMoon story, anElkstory, aCoyote and
Wolf story, etc.They hadforgotten allofthese, andcould tellnone
ofthem properly orindetail. Stories similar tothefollowing Thomp-
sontalesthey didnotremember having heard :Kokwe'la story,^ Great
Deluge story. Great Fire story, Origin ofFire story,^ story ofvisiting a
country underneath the earth, story oftheorigin ofdaylight and
darkness, story ofstars coming down andmarrying women,^ Sun
coming down andobtaining abright-colored blanket.'' Perhaps some
very oldpeople mightknowsome ofthese stories.

they didnotknowhow toact,hetaught them. Hedidmany good,
helpful, andkind things, andnever fooled people, likeCoyote. He
was likeChrist ofthewhites, because hedidmany wonderful things,
andalways spoke goodanddidgood. Atlastheascended tothesky,
andwastransformed intothemoon.
3.Coyote's Son.^
Coyote wasjealous ofhissonT6'rt6rsEmstEm, andwanted to
getridofhim.Hetoldhimthatheknew ofaneagle's nest inatree.
Heinduced himtogothere withhimandclimb for it,saying thathe
wanted theyoung eagles fortheir tail-feathers. When upquite high,
theyouth looked down andsawhisfather blinking hiseyes. Hesaid,
"Why areyoudoing that, father?" Coyote answered, "Iamafraid
some dustmaygetintomyeyesandblind me." Byblinking hiseyes
Coyote made thetreegrow tall. Each time heblinked, thetree
grew. To'rtorsEmstEm looked down again, andsaw hisfather still
looking upandblinking hiseyes. The treegrewupuntil itreached
thesky. Here To'rtorsEmstEm found himself inanewcountry.
Hetravelled about, andatlastcame toalodgewhere heheard talking.
There weretwoSpider people insidewhowere quarrelling about Indian-
hemp. Onesaid itgrewoneway,andtheother said itgrew another
way. Onesaid itbelonged tohim,andtheother said itbelonged to
him.Headdressed them, saying, "Grandchildren, Iwantyoutotake
meback tomycountry." They paidnoattention. Hespoke again,
andoffered themsome beads, buttheypaidnoheed. Then heoffered
them necklaces, but stillthey paidnoheed. Hethought tohimself,
"They areonly interested inIndian-hemp." Then heoffered them
eachtwofathoms ofIndian-hemp. Atoncetheyceased their quarrel-
lingandbecame attentive. They promised tolethimdown tohis
country byarope. They puthim intoabasket, towhich they
fastened theendoftherope. They said,"You willstop fourtimes
onyourwaydown. Youmust not rise,butturn over. Then the
basket will proceed. When thebasket stops thefourth time, you
willbeontheearth ;andwhenyouhear thegrass, you willknow that

up.Td'rtorsEmstEm wenthome, found hisfather, andkilled him.
4.Coyote andtheSun.
TheSunhad killed Coyote's children, andCoyote resolved totake
revenge. Helayinwait;andwhen theSuncamedown from thesky
todrink, hekilled himandcutout hisheart. Atonce theearth
became totally dark. Coyote tried togohome carrying Sun's heart;
buteach timehemade astep, hetrodontheSun (orSun's body).
Hecouldmake noprogress ;andatlasthewasexhausted, andplaced the
heartontheSun. The latter atoncecame tolife,andtherewaslight
over theworld, asbefore.
5.Coyote introduces Salmon,^
Fourwomen wholivedontheColumbia River hadadamwhich held
thesalmon fromascending totheinterior. Whoever came nearthem
wasattacked andeaten bythem. Coyote heard ofthem and their
salmon, andresolved togoandbreak thedam. Hechanged himself
intoaboard, and floated down thestream untilhereached thedam.
Then hechanged himself intoababy. Thewomen wereoutonthedam
catching salmon. Theysawhim,and,thinking thathewasababy, said
theywould takehimtotheir house, andrearhimastheir son.They
were glad tohaveachild, fortheyhadneither husbands norchildren.
After Coyote hadbeenwiththem awhile, hewanted togooutonthe
dam tohave adrink. They gave their permission. Hebegan to
undermine andbreak upthedam, butdidnotstayvery long forfear
ofarousing their suspicions. Hedidsoonthree days, andthedam
wasnearly broken through. Onthefourth dayhestaid longer than
usual, andthewomen went toseewhatwasthematter. When they
came totheriver-bank andlooked down, theysawCoyote tearing
down theirdam. They rushed athimandclubbed himoverhands
andarms; buttheywere protected byarmor. Coyote toreoutthelast
pieces. Now thewater rushed through thebreak, andCoyote jumped
totheopposite side. Most ofthedamwascarried away, andgreat
numbers ofsalmon ascended theriver. Coyote conducted them up
thestreams, introducing them inmany places. Thus Coyote bene-
fited hispeople. Before thistheIndian tribes oftheinterior hadno
salmon.

andplace hishead inthegapwith hismouth wide open. People

crossing the hillswalked into hismouth, andoninto hisstomach,
without noticing it.Thus hehadswallowed andeatenmany people.
Coyote heard ofthismonster, and said,"Oh, heisnothing! Ishall
goand killhim." Hetookalong pole oftamarack, andwentupthe
hills. Asheneared apass, heheard avoice saying, "Where areyou
going, Coyote?" Heanswered, "Iamseeking themonster who eats
men. Iwillfindhim,andlearn ifheeatsmen. Ido,buthedoes
not." Coyote went on.Again thevoice said,"Don't killhim!"
Coyote answered, "Well, ifyoupromise nottoeatpeople, Iwillspare
you." Themonster promised. Then Coyote transformed himinto
thewewel' Jc-b'ird, saying, "You shall beabirdwith abigmouth,
butshallnotbeable toeatpeople anymore."
7.Division oftheCannibal's Body.^
Once alargemonster inhabited thecountry around themouth of
thePalouse River. Hehadkilledmany people. Coyote, orsome other
man gifted with magic, made uphismind toridthecountry ofthis
evilbeing. Hewent tohishouse andattacked him. Thecombat
lasted along time, andended with themonster's death. Then the
-victor took ofiftheornaments andclothing ofhisvictim, andthrew
them about. Then hecutupthebody, andthrew apiece toeach
tribe. Hethrew theheaddown theriver totheWishram: therefore
theynowhave bigheads. Hethrew thescalp totheCrows, forthey
have long hair.Hecutouttheribsandchestandthrew them tothe
NezPerce: therefore they arelarge-bodied. Hethrew thelegstothe
Blackfeet: therefore they areatallpeople. Hethrew theheart to
theCoeur d'Alene: therefore theybecame noted asbrave fighters,
andofcruel disposition. Thus hethrew pieces toallthetribes,—to
theSalish, totheColumbias, andsoon.^Hethought every onehad
received apiece. Then heremembered thattwo tribes hadbeen
forgotten. Helooked around, butcould findnoscraps togivethem.
Hetook hisknife, and, afterwiping itwithabunch ofgrass, threw it
toone tribe, probably theThompson. Hethrew thegrass tothe
SEntatuu'li.^ Therefore the latter have never been anumerous
people.^

8.TheSunandtheMoon.^
Thepeople hadtrouble with thesun.They could notmanage to
make itgoright. They tried different people tocarry it;butthey
didnotdoitproperly, andthepeople deposed them. Most ofthem
didnotcarry itattheright distance from theearth. Some went ina
zigzag course, sometimes toofaraway, then toonear. Those who
carried ittoonear killedmany people bytheheat. Then thepeople
chose Robin tocarry thesun, fortheycould notdowithout heatand
light. Hehadtotravel only inthedaytime, foratnight themoonwas
carried instead. Robin carried thesun,butsooncame sonear tothe
earth that thepeople had tofleetothewater andkeep themselves
immersed allday. Soon even thewater gothot. Therefore they
deposed Robin, and elected aone-eyed man called .s.tsakozaltsasa'-
xkEn inhisstead. Thismanwasable tokeep astraight andeven
course inthesky,andcarries thesunyet.
Atthesame time thepeople hadtrouble with themoon. They
had tried several people tocarry it,butnone ofthem haddone it
properly. Coyote hadoffered tocarry it,butthepeople didnottrust
him. Atlastthey thought theywould tryhim. Inhisnightly
travels hecalled outpeople's names, and toldwhat theywere doing.
When hesawmarried people together, hecalled outtheirnames loudly,
sothatevery onecould hear,andtoldwhat theywere doing. This
somuch annoyed thepeople, thattheydeposed him,andasked Spo-
xani'tcElt^totake hisplace. The latter didhiswork perfectly, and
carries themoon yet.
9.Toad andtheMoon.^
After Spoxanl'tcElt hadtaken uptheduty ofbeing moon, heinvited
thepeople toafeast. Somany people went tothefeast, that his
house wassooncrowded. Toadcame along, andfound thehouse full.
Sheasked where shewastosit;andheanswered, "There isnoplace to
sit." Shebecame angry, andreturned toherown house. Then she
made aheavy rain,which penetrated everything andputoutlights
and fires. Asmore people arrived, theycrowded inside, saying,
"Chief, where arewetosit? Itiswetoutside." Atlast, astherain
came pouring through theroofofthehouse, allthepeople cried aloud,
"Chief, where arewetosit?Where canwegotobeoutoftherain?"
Theywentfrom tenttotent,but itrained through them all.Theywent
under canoes, but itrained through them also. Finally theysawa

and satthere. Atonce therainstopped. Thepeople tried topull
Toad offhisface,butdidnotsucceed. Themarks ofToadmay still

10.TheWind.^
Thewind used toblowhard allthetime. Thepeople hadnopeace,
andmany were hurt. Then Coyote made asnare and tried tocatch
theWind, butWind always passed through hissnare. Hemade his
snare smaller and smaller, and finally caught theWind. Then he
tookaway hispower ofhurting thepeople, andreleased it.Since
then thewind hasbeen asweknow itto-day.
II.TheHotandCold Winds.^
Formerly theEarth wasvexed withhotandcoldwinds, caused by
theWind people, whowere striving witheach other. TheCold-Wind
people lived inthefarnorth, andtheHot-Wind people inthesouth.
TheCold-Wind people would press thebag inwhich theykept the
wind intheir house, andimmediately acoldwindwould rush out,and
blow over thecountry. When itreached theHot-Wind people, they
became cold,andatoncepressed theirwind-bag, andahotwindrushed
north. When itreached theCold-Wind people, theybecame sick,
andthey pressed their bag. Thus theconflict continued constantly
between thetwo.Some onemade peace between these people, or
curtailed their powers. Therefore coldandwarm winds blow asthey
donow.
12,Heat andCold.^
HeatandColdweretwobrothers, theformer good-looking, andthe
latter ugly. One fallHeat travelled south, andthenColdmade up
hismind tokillthepeople. Hemade theweather socold thatmost
ofthepeople died. Heat hurried back tosavethem, andmade the
weather sohotthathekilled hisbrother, andthefrostand iceand
snow which hehadmade disappeared. Itwasthen ordained that
coldshould notprevail long atatime,andshould always bedriven
awaybyheat.Weseethekilling ofColdbyhisbrother every spring.

Thunder used tokillmany people byshooting down large arrow-
stones. When hewanted rain,hesang.Amanwent tohishouse in
thehighmountains, andtoreuphisdress, which wasmade offeathers.

After thisthethunder wasonly able tothunder when itwasabout to
rain,andcould not killpeople anymore.
14.Origin ofDeath.^
Once awoman hadtwin children^who fainted away. Possibly
theyonly slept. Their mother leftthem inthemorning; andwhen she
returned intheevening, theywere stilllying there. Shenoticed tracks
liketheirs around thehouse: therefore shethought theymustcome to
lifeandplayduring herabsence. Onedayshestoleonthem unseen,
andfound them arguing witheach other inside thelodge. One said,
"Itisbetter tobedead;"andtheother said, "Itisbetter tobealive."
When theysaw her,theystopped talking; andsince then people die
from time totime. There arealways some being bornandsome dying
atthesame time, always some living onesandsome dead ones. Had
sheremained hidden, andallowed them tofinish theirargument, one
would have prevailed overtheother, andtherewould havebeen either
nolifeornodeath.

17.TheWater-Mystery.^
Once anumber ofpeople weredancing atasmall lakenearCheney,
intheterritory oftheSpokane. Suddenly theybecame aware ofa
strange smell; andoneofthem atonce said,"That is.stsomkestci'nt.^
Theman looked around, and allthepeople looked towhere hewas
looking. They sawfourmenstanding about anequal distance apart
from each other. Allwore buffalo-skins around theshoulders, hair-
sideout(and eachhad hishairdoneupsothat itstood outtothe
side?). Asthepeople looked, theydisappeared, andfourbushes grew
upwhere they disappeared. These bushes were there lately, and
probably may stillbeseen.
18.TheWater-Buffalo.
There wasawater-mystery intheCoeur d'Alene Lake. Ithad
horns likeabuffalo, and issaid tohavebeen otherwise somewhat like
abuffalo. Once amanwaspaddling hiscanoe along theshore inthe
dark. When opposite aplacewhere abushgrows neartheshore, his
canoe stood still.Hepaddled hard, butthecanoe would notmove.
Then hefeltalong thegunwales ofthecanoe, anddiscovered ahorn
holding thecanoe oneach side.Heknew theWater-Buffalo hadcaught
him.Heasked himtolethimgo,andgavehimapresent. Atoncehe
settled inthewater, andthemanpaddled away. Ever afterwards
people were careful topray,andmake anoffering atthisplace. The
offerings were placed near thebush.

Near thehead ofSanJoeRiver isalake calledNka'mEmEn (Swal-

2.TheDog-Children.^
Once therewasagirlwhoHved nearthemouth oftheFraser River.
Sherefused alloffers ofmarriage. Atlastastrange youngman visited
heratnight and laywith her. Shewondered whohecould be,and
made uphermind tomark him. Sheputredpaint onthepalms
ofherhands; andwhen heappeared thefollowing night inthedark,
sheembraced him, leaving theimprints ofherhands onhissides. She
never went outofthehouse, butthenextmorning shewent outtosee
ifshecould recognize theyoung man. Theyoung menwere playing,
andcalled out,"Oh, seethegirl! Shehascome toseeusplay." As
shecould seenone ofthem withanymarks, shewent home. When
nearthehouse, shesawherfather's largedogbeing fedbyhermother,
andonhissideswere herhand-marks. Hermother said,"Who has
beenmaking afoolofthedogbypainting hissides?" The girlwas
ashamed, went in,andcried toherself. Induetime shegave birth
toeleven pups,—fivemaleand sixfemale. One ofthelatter was
halfblack and halfwhite. Thepeople werevery angry. They beat
thedognearly todeath, and leftthegirlandherchildren todie.
When theywere gone, thedogbecame aman,andwent intothe
woods, where hehealed himself. Thepups were hungry: therefore
theirmother went atnight with atorch todigclams onthebeach
during ebb-tide. Onherreturn, when near thehouse, sheheard the
pups dancing, and singing, "She thinks wearedogs, butwearechil-
dren." Theblackandwhite onewasonwatch, andwarned theothers
oftheir mother's approach ;sothey allhastily donned their skinsand
kept quiet. Shelooked about, andsawchildren's tracks where they
hadbeen dancing. She said, "It isstrange thatyouaredogs, and
stillyougivenowarning, nor tellwhen strangers arearound dancing."
Thefollowing night, when shewent outafter clams, sheputherrobe
onastick, tiedhertorch toanother onebyitsside,andhurried home.
Thepupsthought shewas stillatthebeach, andkeptondancing and
singing. Shecreptupstealthily, jumped over theoneonwatch, and
seized theskins oftheothers before theycould getthem, andthrew
them into the fire.Thus theyremained children, while theblack
andwhite oneremained adog.
Now, their father returned intheform ofagood-looking man,and
hunted forthefamily. Hekilledmany goatsanddeer,andsoonhad
great quantities ofmeatand fat.Heputmuch fatintothecaches of

known howwell offthegirlhadbecome. Then thepeople allreturned,
andwere fedbyDog-Man. Thetenchildren ofthegirlgrewuptobe
handsome people, andtheymarried among themselves.^
3.TheFish-Man.
Somewhere nearthemouth oftheEraser River lived agirlwhohad
refused allsuitors. After awhile amancame tovisit her,andlay
with heratnight. The girlsaid tohim,"You must stay until day-
light, andshow yourself tomyparents." Heanswered, "No, Iam
toopoor. Your people would notlikeme." Ashecontinued tocome
every night, thegirltoldherparents, andtheywereveryangry. Then
Fish-Man caused theseatorecede formany miles from thevillage.
Heletallthefresh-water streams dryup,andnorain fall.The ani-
malsbecame thirsty, and leftthecountry. Thepeople could getno
fish,nogame, andnowater todrink. The girltoldthepeople,"My
lover hasdone this,because youwerewroth withhimandrefused him."
Then thepeople made alongwalk ofplanks over themud totheedge
ofthesea. Attheendofthisthey builtalarge platform ofplanks,
which theycovered with mats. They heaped many woollen blankets
onit.Then theydressed thegirlinafinerobe,combed andoiled her
hair, painted herface,andputdown onherhead. Then they placed
heronthetopoftheblankets, and leftherthere. Atonce thesky
became overcast, rain fell,thesprings burst out,thestreams ran,and
theseacame in.Thepeople watched until thesearose,andfloated
theplatform with theblankets. Theysawamanclimb upbeside the
girl.They stood up;andthe girlcalled, "Now, alliswell. Ishall
visityousoon." Night came on,andtheysawthem nomore. In
twodays shecame back, andtoldthepeople, "Ilivebelow thesea,in
thefishcountry. Thehouses there arejustthesame ashere,andthe
people liveinthesameway." Shereturned again with herhusband,
bringing presents offish. She said, "Henceforth people here shall
always beable tocatch plenty offish." Oncemore shecame toshow
them hernewly-born child. After thatshereturned tothesea,and
wasnever seen again.
4.Origin oftheSturgeon.
There wasaboyatMusquiam whowasalways crying. Whatever
thepeople didforhim, stillhecried. Oneday hissister asked him
what hewanted; andheanswered, "Iamcrying forsturgeon." His
sisterwent tothewater, dived in,andcameback intheform ofastur-
geon, butshehadelkantlers projecting from hercheeks, which were

stufifed with goat's wool inside. Shetoldthepeople thatwhen they
caught sturgeon, theymust never putthebones intothe fire,butmust
always throw them intothewater. Shereturned tothewater, and
became arealsturgeon. After thisthepeople fished andcaught
sturgeon. They gavesome totheboytoeat,andheceased crying.
This isthereason that allsturgeon seem tobefemale.
5.TheDeluge.^
Atonetime therewasaflood thatcovered theearth, andmost of
thepeople were drowned. When thewaters rose, thepeople fledto
themountains; butsomewereovertaken anddrowned ontheway,and
others weredrowned onthetops ofthelower mountains. Alltheland
wasflooded except thetops ofafewvery highmountains. Xalsand
hiswifeanddaughters escaped inalarge canoe. They were chiefs.
After paddling about formany daysand nights, theybecame very
tired. They drifted against thetopofQotse'lis Mountain, andthere
theymade aholethrough astone, andmoored theircanoe bypassing
aheavy cedar-bark cable through thehole. Here they staidand
gauged theincrease anddecrease ofthewater with stakes asmarks.
After flowing andreceding several times, thewater atlastreceded,
andthey cast offtheir canoe. The floodnowsubsided rapidly, and
theyfound themselves intheLower Fraser Valley. Some saytheyhad
drifted there from thesouth. Now allthewater wasgone, excepting
some thatremained intheform oflakesandponds, filling upthehol-
lowsanddepressions. After thisXals travelled over theworld, and
taught thesurvivors ofthefloodhowtoactandhow towork. Hewas
very wise,andtaught thepeople how topray, anddoevery kind of
work. Hetravelled among alltheneighboring coast tribes.

far,andthencommitted suicide." Hesatbythelakeandspat into
thewater. The saliva descended through thewater, entered the
lodge ofthechiefwho lived atthebottom ofthelake,and fellonthe
stomach ofhisdaughter, who atoncebecame sick. Xwiama'ta said
tohimself, "There isnothing tolive for. Icannot getwell.<Iwill
throw myself intothelake." Hedived, anddescended untilhesawa
ladder standing up,which ledintothechief's house. Heentered, and
found thechief's daughter very sick. The chief toldhimthatshe
wasdying, andasked himtotrytocure her.Hecured herbyscraping
offthespittle, andatonce shebecame well. Inreturn thechief cured
Xwiama'ta's sickness. They werevery grateful, andshowed himthe
.sxo'exo'e mask. They said itwas ofvery great value, and toldhim
how touse it.They presented ittohim. They promised tosend it.
Xwiama'ta returned home, andsent hissister Swalsta't tofishinthe
lake. While shewas fishing, theWater people attached themask to
herhook. Shethought shehadcaught afish.When shelanded it
andsawthefeathers onit,sheranaway infright. Herbrother sent
herback. Shewrapped itinablanket, andput itinalarge basket and
carried ithome. Then herbrother showed itatdances.
The .sxo'exo'e mask hadafeathered head, protruding eyes,
feathered hands, andfeathered feetandknees. Itcould onlybeused
bypeople who inherited it.Byintermarriage with people ofHope it
wasintroduced among thepeople ofHammond. Thepeople onthe
NorthArm (near themouth oftheFraser River) made waronthe
Hammond people, and stole their mask. After thisthey used it,
although itdidnotbelong tothem; butthey didnotknow theproper
songanddance thatbelonged tothemask, which always wasusedwhen
itwasexhibited.
7.AMan eats hisSisters' Berries.^
Once therewasamanwho said tohisthree sisters, "Isawmany
all'la 2-berries down theriver. Letusgodown there inacanoe and
pickthem." They arrived attheplace, andpicked berries untilthey
had filled onesetofbaskets. When theyhadplaced them inthe
canoe, thebrother said, "Ihearenemies coming. They will killus.
Allofyoumust hide." Thetwoeldest sisters ranoffintothewoods;
while hehidtheyoungest one inahole,andcovered herwith leaves.
Then hewent tothecanoe andate alltheberries, threw thejuice over
himself, andlaydown inthebottom ofthecanoe asthough hewere
covered with blood. The little girlpeered through theleaves, and
sawwhat hedid. After awhile theelder sisters returned, and, finding
where shewashidden, asked herwhere their brother was. Shetold

went tothecanoe andsawhim, theythought hewasdead. They
said,"The enemies must have killed him. See!heiscovered with
blood." The little girlanswered, "That isnotblood, itisberry-juice."
They tickled hissoles until hemoved andbegan tolaugh. They
asked himwhy hehadacted thus. Heanswered, "Ilonged fora
good feed ofberries." Then they filled theother setofbaskets with
berries andreturned home.

They came toamountain which wascovered with trees. Coyote

thesameway. They were theclouds through which hewaspassing.
Finally hestruck solid ground. Herolled over again; butwhen he
found thatthespoon didnotmove, heknew thathehadreached the
earth. Heuntied himself andwent atonce tohunt deer, ashe
hadbeen requested. Hekilled some, filled thespoon with tallow,

Inthemean timeOld-Coyote hadgonehome, andhadtaken the
Duck wife,whom hedeceived bypretending tobeherhusband.
Hedanced allthetime, andtoldthepeople thathehadpersuaded
hisfather toclimb up.Most ofthepeople believed him, because
helooked sodifferent. Duck actually thought hewasherhusband.
Beetle, however, disbelieved him. Sheputreeds onherback, placed
herbabyonthem, andwent away.
She leftthehouse withherrawhide tump-line dragging behind her.
Shecried allthetime. Coyote's sonfollowed her.Hepassed ten

andstarted tocarry ithome. Hehadgone butalittlewaywhen
thestrap broke. Hissontoldhim totieittogether andgoahead.
Thestrap broke fivetimes, and finally hehadnothing withwhich to

butafew.Then hetook theyolks ofsome oftheeggsandpainted
the thieves,—Fox, Wolf, Raccoon, and others. When hehad
finished, hewentupthe hill,laydown intheshade, andwatched to
seewhatwould happen.^
Itwasnotlongbefore thepeople jumped upandwent togettheir
eggs. Notonly didthey discover that theyhadbeen taken, but
they failed torecognize each other. Then they spied Coyote, who
waslaughing, andgave chase. Foxcaught him; butCoyote struck
him inthechest, saying, "Step aside!" Then hesatdown andtold
Foxthathewould always retain themarks thathehadmade.
Coyote went oneastward tofreeother people thatwere being held

and stilldidnot feelrefreshed. Sohestripped andswamwayout

swam allthewaydown theSnake River without onceturning around.
Finally hecame toadam. FiveSwallow girlswere living there,
whoowned thedamandafish-trap. Heturned intoalittleboy

wereswimming above thedam,andsaw itcoming. They wondered
what itmight be.Coyote waslying there crying lustily. The girls

Onthesixthdaytheyplanned togoanddigroots. They decided to
take thebaby along. They took along water andfood forhim.
After passing two terraces, theycame toaplace where they rested.
They tookoutthewater andfoodandgave ittoCoyote. Heate
everything, anddrank allthewater. Then hebegan tocry."What
isthematter withhim?" they asked. Hekeptoncrying forwater.
Theywentandbrought himmore. Hequickly drank thatandcried
formore. Theyoungest then said,"Tellhimtogoandget ithimself."
They did so,andhecrawled down the hill.When hereached the
first terrace, however, hegotupand ran.When hecame insight
again, hegotdown onhisknees andcrawled; butafter passing the
second terrace, hejumped upandranononcemore. Soon hearrived at
thehouse. There were stores ofdried fishthere. Heate allthefood
inthehouse. Then hetoredown thedam intheriver, digging around
it.Soon thewater began tocome through. Then heimmediately
satdown, andcalled outtothegirls,"Come down, thedam isbroken!"
Theyoungest one said, "Iknow that isCoyote's work." The fish
were running upinshoals. Coyote hadmade aspoon justthesize
ofhishead. Thishetiedon;andwhen hismother hithimonthe
head, hedidnotfeel it,andjustlaughed. Hehadsome black paint,
which hecarried inbags.^ Heuntied oneofthese, andimmediately
itbecame dark, sothatthey could notseehim. Then hewentupa
hill,andcalleddown tothem totake care ofhischildren, ifheshould
have any. "The youngest oneknew me," hesaid,"soperhaps she
willnothaveababy." Nevertheless hegavethem allnames.
Then Coyote ledthesalmon tothemouth ofSnake River. His
blanket wasmade oftwisted reeds. Hewanted some fish: sohe
wentdown totheriverandcalled tothesalmon,"Imade you, there-
foreswim outtome." Atonceasalmon jumped ashore. Hewrapped
itinhisblanket, but itjumped through andgotaway. Then hewas
puzzled, anddidnotknowwhat todo.Hearose and hithiship.^
Dung dropped outandturned intoboys,whobegan tofight. He
called tothem, "Look out! Don't hitoneanother's eyes! Come
hereand tellmehow tocatch salmon!" Theyoungest said tohim,
"Go to'Tushe' (onSnake River) andgetaclub." Hedidashe
was told,andcame back towards evening. Hewentdown tothe
river, andshouted, "Imade you,come out!" Outjumped asalmon,
which heclubbed onthehead.^ Then hewent totheshade and
cooked it.When hehad finished, hewentdown totheriverand
defecated. Hisdung turned intoalarge rock, which isthere still.

andate it.They were careful nottoawaken Coyote. When they
hadeaten itall,they cutopen Coyote's anus, tookoutthegut,and
cooked itforhim.When Coyote awoke, hethought, "There ismy
fishcooking forme." Hearose, butsawthatnothing was leftbut
thebones. When hesawtheguts, hesaid,"My grandchild must
have leftthese guts here." Hetookaknifeandbegan toeatthem.
Abirdsawhim,andshouted, "You areeating yourown guts!"
Nevertheless hekept oneating. The bird called again, andhe
wondered what shemeant. He feltbehind him,andranhishand
clearuptohiselbow. Hefound that therewasbutalittle piece of
hisintestines left,which heputback. Then hehithishipasecond
time, and thedung which appeared turned into boys, asbefore.
Allbuttheyoungest went back intohim.HetoldCoyote thatthe
thieves were theWolves andaFox,whowere cooking some eggsand
hadtaken hissalmon while hehadbeen asleep.
Coyote wasvery angry, andstarted outtohunt theWolves. He
came totheplacewhere theywere cooking eggs. Not faraway the
Wolves were asleep. Theeggswere done, andCoyote began toeat
them. Hedidnoteat all,however, but left six,oneforeach ofthe
animals. Hecovered themupastheyhadbeen before. TheWolves
andtheFox slept on.Coyote tooksome charcoal andpainted their
faces tomake them look ugly. Hepainted Foxwith theyolk ofan
egg,andputcharcoal onthetipsofhisears.When hehad finished.
Coyote went toanotch onthe hillandwaited toseewhat would
happen. Hecarried fivebags ofblack paint.
Soon oneoftheWolves awoke and called theothers. They went
togettheeggs, andeach took one. Coyote, wayuponthe hill,
laughed tohimself. When theywent togetanother egg,theyfound
nothing but shells. They wondered what thetrouble was. One
looked atanother, and said,"Why, what isthematter withyou?"
Then they teased oneanother about their looks. Foxwasyellow
allover. They sooncame totheconclusion that thiswasCoyote's
handiwork; and, indeed, therewasCoyote laughing atthem.^ They
gave chase, andFoxalmost caught him. Coyote, however, said,
"We arefriends," andwith thatheopened asack ofpaint and dis-
appeared inthedarkness. When itcleared up,hewasontheother
sideofthecanyon, stilllaughing. Sotheydecided toleavehimalone.

theysawthathewaswatching them, they gotup.Heswam down-
stream, jumping upanddown intheswift current.
Asheswam along, hecaught sight offiveSwallows who lived at
Dalles onColumbia River, where theyhadmade adam toprevent the
salmon from going upstream. Coyote knew this,andturned himself
intoachild inacradle, inwhich hefloated down the river. The
Swallow girlssawhimcoming, andheappeared tothem asacrying
infant. They thought thatsome onehadbeen drowned, andthat
thiswasthatperson's child drifting down. Theyswam outtorescue
him. They agreed thatwhoever succeeded inreaching him first
wasentitled tokeep him. The eldest girlwon. Shetook him,and
they allwenthome.
Thebaby grewupvery quickly. The girlsused togotothe hills
togather roots. They used toplay with Coyote. Theyoungest
girl,however, suspected thattherewassomething strange about him,
andcame totheconclusion that itwasCoyote, andnorealbaby atall.
The others didnotsuspect anything. Onedaytheywent outfor
roots. Theinfant cried forwater (ak'dts). One ofthegirls toldhim
togoandgetwater himself, since itwasbutashort distance away.
Hecreptdown the hill.When hereached theravine andheknew
thatthey could nolonger seehim,hestoodupandranasfastashe
could. Then, when hecame insight again, hewentdown onhis
knees andcrept likeababy.
Atlasthereached thehutofthe girls,which waswellstocked with
food. Coyote helped himself. When hehad finished eating, he
began toteardown thedam, saying, "There shallnolonger beadam
inthis river. Many Indians willcome here tolive." When hehad
broken thedam, heshouted, "Mother, come down! Ourdam is
broken, and thewater isgone." When the girls heard this, the
youngest onescolded theothers, and toldthem that thebabywas
none other than Coyote. Coyote ran off,andthey started tofollow
him.
Thesalmon nowcrowded upthe river. Coyote followed them.
Hecalled foronetocome ashore. Hewanted tocatch itinhisold
blanket. Thesalmon knew thathehadbeen theonetoteardown
thedam: therefore theyspokeamong themselves, anddecided that
oneoftheirnumber should goandbecaught. Theblanket, however,
wassooldthat itwould notholdthesalmon. Coyote tried repeatedly,
but ittoreevery time. Finally Beaver advised himtogetastickand
hitthesalmon onthehead. Hekilled it,'-builtafire,putthesalmon
ontocook, andwent tosleep.
Ashelayasleep, fiveWolves sawhimand thesalmon. They
wondered howtheycould steal thesalmon without disturbing Coyote.

Oneofthem suggested thattheyaskhimwhether theymight eatthe
salmon. They putthequestion, andherepHed, "Mmmm!" They
interpreted thisasmeaning "Yes!" took the fish,andate it.
Coyote wassound asleep. One oftheyounger Wolves wentup
tohimfrom behind, slituphisanus, andcutouthisbowels. Even
thenhedidnotawaken. Then theWolves ranaway. When Coyote
awoke, hesawthat hissalmon wasgoneandthat initsplace layhis
own guts. They wereonastick roasting over the fire,astheWolves
had leftthem. Coyote thought tohimself, "My grand-daughter
hasbeen here,andhas leftsome food forme." Hebegan toeat,and
likedthem sowell, thathesaidtohimself, "My grand-daughter ought
tohave leftmore." Hehadnotquite finished eating when the
Wolves, whowerewatching himfrom thebrush, called out,"You are
eating yourown guts!" Coyote heard what they said.He felt
behind him,andhishandwent right intothecavity leftbyhisbowels.
Hetook thepiece ofgutthatwas leftandput itback. Then he
gave chase totheWolves, forhesuspected themandwasvery angry.
Hefollowed themuptheriver totheplace where they lived. He
found them allfast asleep. They hadcooked eggs intheground.
Coyote uncovered theeggsandatethem allup,leaving butonefor
each oftheWolves andtheother animals thatwere there. Then,
while theywere stillasleep, heremodelled their faces, pulling outtheir
noses, pushing intheir cheeks, andmaking them gray, justaswolves
arenow. Herubbed Foxwith theyolk ofanegg,andgavehimthe
color hehasnow.HemadeSkunk black andwhite. Then hewent
ojffashort distance andwatched toseewhatwould happen.
"Our eggsmust beready now," saidtheanimals when theyawoke.
They sentGround-Hog tosee iftheywere done. Ground-Hog saw
theegg-shell andanegg,andannounced that alltheeggswere cooked.
Theanimals uncovered theoven,andfound nothing butshells. While
theywere doing this,they noticed oneanother's faces, andmade fun
ofoneanother, saying, "You lookvery curious."—"Look atFox,
heisallred!" andmany similar things. Then they espied Coyote
onthe hill.Hewaslaughing andmaking funofthem. They all
ranafter him. Foxwastheswiftest, buthewasCoyote's best friend.
When hecaught uptohim,they satdown together andtalked and
laughed. Then theywent on.

Coyote went onuptheriver. Heheard anoise, andsawwhat he
believed tobeaduck flying above him. Itcame nearer, and, ashe

didnotknow what itwas.Hethrew itintotheriverandwent on
hisway. After awhile heheard thesame noise, andwas hitagain
inthesame way. Itrequired thesame violent wrench asbefore to
remove what had hithim. Then hethrew itinto theriver. This
happened four times. When itstruck himthe fifth time, hedecided
tocook it.Hepulled itoff,cut itup,made afireofpine-cones, and
broiled itonastick. Itsmelled just like fatmeat. When itwas
done, hetasted it,andfound ittasted likecow-teats. Itwasavulva

regretted thathehadeaten it.Hewas thirsty, andlooked forwater.
Soonhefound agood spring, andstooped over todrink. Asheopened

hadflown over theriver tohunt deer,andhad lefttheir pretty sister
athome alonemaking clothes. Before leaving hertheyhadtoldher
thatanymanwhochanced tocome totheircamp would beher

along; andwhen hesawthebigtent, hepeeked inthrough ahole.
There hesawthe girlsitting making finethings. Hesawhowhand-
some shewas,anddeliberated how toget in.Hewent backsome
distance, andbymagic procured five eagle's feathers tipped with

ahandsome manwith nicelong hair. The girlreceived himandtold
himwhere tosit.Sheputherwork away; and, after cooking food
forhim, sheset itbefore himandgavehimaforkmade ofbone.
Coyote tookabigpiece, forhehadforgotten allabout thelossofhis

When hehadfinished eating, helayonhisbackandsang asong.
Soon after hefellasleep. Ashelaythere, hemoved about. His

Then hesaid toher,"Here aresome clothes that Ibrought for

Coyote thought what ahandsome man hewas.HetoldCoyote to
move over, andCoyote moved closer tothe girl.Thesecond one
came in,andthesame happened. Sowith eachoneofthem, until
finally the fifthcame inand toldhim tomove still closer. Bythis
time hewasalmost onthe girl's lap.The eldest said,"Don't be
mean!" Then Coyote married the girl.
The brothers considered Coyote afineman. They were greatly
pleased with thepresents hehadgiven tothem. Coyote staid at
home oneday. The following dayhewanted toaccompany the
brothers when theywent hunting. Hiswifetoldhimthatthebrothers
wereaccustomed tohuntontheother side oftheriver, andthey did
notwanthimtogoalong because theywere going sofarthathecould
notfollow them. Theyoungest brother, however, said, "Oh, let
himcome along!" They came tothe river, where they took off
their clothes andstarted toflyacross. They toldCoyote toutter
nosound. Then they flewupintothe air,while heclung totwoof
them. They uttered thegoose-cry, andthusthey crossed theriver.
Itdidnottake long before Coyote began toscream. Assoon ashe
did so,they allfelldown. They rebuked him,andtoldhimtokeep
quiet. Theywentonforashort distance, hunting formountain-sheep
andother biggame. Soon afawn appeared, andCoyote shot it.
Heskinned itandwentdown totheriver, thinking thathehaddone
enough. Hetook thegutsand allwith him. After having walked
down along thebank alittleway, hewent inswimming. TheGoose
brothers came uptohim toseewhat hehadcaught. They took the
fawnandthrew itintotheriver. Thegutscaught Coyote around the
body. Hewasashamed. Then theoldest brother suggested that
they cross back. Sotheymade ready their packs andprepared to
cross. They putCoyote ontopofthem. They flewupanduttered
their cry. Inthemiddle ofthestream Coyote began toshout, and
they felldown fast.They toldhimtokeep still,butherefused todo

toleave theplace.
They went on,taking along only theirbows andarrows. They
tooknofood with them, andhadnothing toeatforfifteen days.
Theyounger brother almost starved. Hisbrother took hisbowstring
andthebacking ofthebow, both ofwhich weremade ofsinew, and
gavethem tohim toeat. Finally theycame insight ofalarge house.
They went in.Anoldgray-haired giantwas living therewhohad
fourgrown daughters andalittle one.Theyoungest girl'snamewas
Winter (xd'lpxa'lp'^). Thehouse was fulloficeandwithout even
alittle fire.Theoldmanwasstark naked. Theprivates ofthegirls
were notcovered. Thefourolder girlshadanunderground house to
themselves. They were working onbeautiful clothing outside the
house. Roots andother property were there too.The giant sent
Winter tocallhersisters. They were tocook forhim. Asshethrew
thedoor open, they shouted, "You dirty thing!whydoyoucome
here?" Shedelivered hermessage, andthesisters promised tocome
soon. They cooked alarge dishful offood,which theygave totheir
father.^ While theywere leaving, the little girlbrought twospoons
andatethefoodwithherfather. Between them they ate itall.Then
theoldman sentWinter toherelder sisters totellthem topaint their

toswallow themonster first. Coyote drew inhisbreath, andthe
monster could hardly withstand thesuction. Hesaid,"Doggone you!
youarestronger than Ithought." Coyote then said,"Now itis
your turn." Themonster tried hard tomove Coyote, buthewas
tied fast. Coyote then tried asecond time, andwasable tomove
themonster alittle. When themonster tried again, oneoftheropes
that heldCoyote broke. Thenext time alltheropes broke, and
Coyote wasdrawn towards themonster. Heargued with him,
because theycould notagree onthewayCoyote should enter hisbody.
Themonster tried togethim togointhrough theanus ortheears;
Coyote, however, insisted ongoing inthrough themouth, and at
lastthemonster consented. Heopened hismouth, andCoyote went
in.Inside hemetRattlesnake, whowanted tobitehim. Coyote
trampled himunder foot,thereby flattening hisnose,andreviled him
fornotbiting themonster. Farther inhemet Grizzly-Bear, and
reproached him fornotkilling themonster. Finally hereached the
place where themonster's heart washanging. Hestabbed itwith
hisknife. Themonster now tried tocoaxCoyote tocome out.He
refused, however, andproceeded tobuild afiredirectly under the
heart. Then hecut it.Heordered thepeople togetready tostep
outbefore themonster should die.They went out,Coyote lastof
all.Themonster maybeseen atKamiah to-day, andtheheart is
there too.
Then Coyote decided tocutupthemonster andtodivide itamong
thepeople.^ Out ofitsfeethemade theBlackfeet. TheCrow, the
Sioux, andtheBannock were allmade outofdifferent parts ofits
body. While Coyote wasstanding there, some onesaid,"What did
youtake yourself?" andhereplied, "Tobewise (?)." Then he
called forwater. Hewashed hishands and scattered thewater,
saying, "You shall betheNez Perces, asmall tribe, butyou shall
bethemost powerful ofallthepeople."

When hehaddone so,heputaband ofbrush (?)grass around his
head. Then hewentupahillandlooked forthemonster, which
could see allover theworld andcould discern even thesmallest
objects. Heknew thatCoyote wascoming, andwas sore afraid.
Hehadnotseenhimyet,butwaskeeping asharp lookout.
Coyote looked over theedge ofthe hill,andshouted, "Let ushave
asucking-match!" Themonster was stillunable toseehim,andhad
notthefaintest ideawhere hewas.Hewasverymuch frightened.
Foralong time hedidnotanswer: hewasthinking what todo.
Finally hesaid toCoyote, "You must begin." Coyote satupand
sucked. Heshook andstrained themonster. When hehadfinished,
hetoldthemonster totry.Assoon asthelatter began tosuck,
Coyote began toshake andjump. First theropeonMount Walawa'-
maxe broke, then theoneontheSeven-Devils Mountain, butthethird
rope held. Finally itgaveway. Then heflewtoward themonster.
AsCoyote wasbeing swept down the hill,hethrew some roots onit,
saying, "Inthefuture theNezPerce Indians shallcome here todig
roots." Then hetooksome white paint andthrew itdown, saying,
"Inthefuture theIndians willgetpaint here." Then hethrewdown
kaus-TOOts inthesameway. Last ofallhethrewdown camas-roots.
Then hewasswept intothemouth ofthemonster anddown histhroat.
Once inside, hewent right tohisheart. Hefound itcovered with
fatand grease. Other people were inside. Heasked them,"Why
don't youeatthis?" Then hebuilt afire.Themonster felt it,and
called toCoyote tocome out."Come out! Iwill letyougo,"he
said. Coyote, however, paidnoattention. Hetold thepeople to
beready torushoutbyway oftheears, eyes, and nose, andany
other possible exit.Hesaidthathewould gather upthose thatwere
onlybones andhadbeendead along time, andtakethem outthe
back way. Then hecuttheheart with hisknives. Themonster
roared tohimtocome out,butCoyote merely wentoncutting. One
after another hisknives broke. Hehadalmost finished cutting out
theheartwhen thelastonebroke :sohetook theheart inhishands
andtore itout.Then everybody rushed togetoutatthedifferent
openings before themonster died. Coyote wasthelastonetoleave.
Hethrew thebones outthebackway. Sothey allmanaged toget
out.Though thetreeswereblooming, they didnotknowwhat season
itwas. Stillthey rejoiced greatly.
Coyote nowbegan tobutcher themonster. Hethrew theskin to
Montana, and said,"This shall betheBlackfoot Indians, andthey
shall betall,stout men." Theother parts ofthebody hethrew in
different directions, andthusmade thedifferent tribes. After the

said, "Youhavedone nothing fortheplacewhere wearenow living."
There wassome blood leftonhishands andontheground. Coyote
sprinkled itover theplace, saying, "This blood shallbeIndians inthe
future. They shall begood warriors andstrong, butthey shall be
fewinnumber." These were theNezPerce Indians. After thishe
spoke tothepeople, and toldthem that allthecountry about there
would beoccupied byIndians, some ofwhom would befriendly, and
others would behostile. Then everybody started home.
5.Coyote's Wars.^
Coyote wastravelling upstream. Heheard anoise likethesawing
ofwood. Hestood stilland listened. TwoHumming-Birds were
there, theonly living things about. They said toCoyote, "Let us
havewar!" Coyote heard them, and,throwing hisbowandarrow
down infront ofhim, replied, "That iswhat Ihavebeen looking for,
alight." With thathejumped about. Heranuptheridge toward
them; andtheycamedown thecanyon, andrushed athimfromboth
sides. They killed Coyote, and toldhimthathewas tobenothing
butCoyote. They dragged him totheriver andthrew him into
thewater.
Hefloated down thestream until hisbody drifted ashore. Magpie
sawhimlying dead, andbegan pecking athiseyes,which awakened
Coyote. HesaidtoMagpie, "That isnotright. Iwasjustdreaming
about getting some girls atthehead ofthecanyon." Magpie replied,
"There aretwoHumming-Birds uptherewho killeverybody, and
they aretheoneswho killed you. They were puttherewhen the
world was firstmade. Listen towhat Itellyounow! Return the
wayyoucame. Make yourself anoldman, and, should they say
anything toyou, tellthem tokillyoubecause youaretired. When
theycome upover the hill,there willbetwowhite sticks withtwo
white feathers onthem onthetopofthe hill. These aretheir hearts.^
Take thecanyon trailandrunashard asyoucantoward thesticks.
Keep going untilyougetthem. Then take hold ofthepoles, break
thefeathers, andthus killthem. That istheonlyway todestroy
them.." Coyote answered, "That iswhat Ithought."
Hetransformed himself intoanoldmanandwent off,inaccordance
with Magpie's instructions. HemettheHumming-Birds, who said,
"Let ushave war!"—"Come down and killme," wasCoyote's
reply ashelaydown onhisback. When they started towards him,

caught upwithhim.Heseized thepoles, however, broke thefeathers,
andthus killed both ofthem. Then Coyote said totheHumming-
Birds, "There areother people coming. Hereafter you shall justbe
pretty little birds, andnot killpeople."
Hecontinued hisjourney uptheriver.^ Soon heheard awoman.
"Whoever youare," she said,"come and liewithme!" When he
came uptoher,hesawthatshewasahandsome girl. Shehad in
herhand aforked white stick. Coyote asked, "Grandchild, what
doyouwant?" Shetoldhim tolookdown andhewould seeabig
mountain-sheep. Ashestooped down todoso,shepierced his
neck with herforked stick, pushed him over, and killed him. She
went toseewhom shehad killed, andsawthat itwasCoyote. She
wasafraid that hisdecaying bodywould smell, soshethrew itinto
theriver. Itfloated down anddrifted ashore atthesame place as
before. Magpie pecked athiseyesandcured him. Coyote told
himthathewasdreaming about somewoman, andMagpie toldhim
that thewoman hadalways been there tokilleverybody. "When
shedoes soagain, climb uptoher;andwhen she tellsyou tolook,
askhertocomedown because youaretired. Then push heroverand
killher. She isamountain-sheep." Coyote answered, "That is
what Ithought." Hewent up,listened, andheard hercalling him.
Heclimbed upandpretended tobetired. Heasked her forthe
stick. "Now, grandchild," hesaid,"showmewhere tolook." She
stepped tothebluff; andwhen shelooked down, heknocked her
head offandkilled her."That iseasy," hesaid,"but hereafter when
people come, they shall eatyou, forfromnowonyou shall onlybea
mountain-sheep.''
Coyote nowresumed hiswayupstream.^ Itwasnotlong before
hemetawoman who called him:"Come and liedown withme!"
Helooked ather,andsawthat shewore afinedressdown toher
waist. The girlstood onthe hillside. Coyote climbed uptoher.
When hereached her,heasked herwhat shehadsaid. "Liewithme,"
wastheanswer. When heobeyed, hersexual organs bitand killed
him. The girlthendragged him totheriverandthrew him in,as
theothers haddone. Hefloated down tothesame place asonthe
previous occasions. Magpie found himand revived him."You
brown-eye!" Coyote said,"why areyourunning about here? Iwas
justgetting some girlsfrom thehead ofthecanyon."—"That was

ofdoing," Coyote informed him.Hewent back, andthe girlcalled
tohimasbefore, "Come andtryme,whoever itisthat isgoing up
there!" Coyote went toherand killed her,asinstructed byMagpie.
Then hedragged hertotheriverandthrew her in,saying, "You shall
never move about again. You shall becalled Mussel, andpeople
shall eatyou. Soon other people willcome."
Hewentonupthestream. Hecame toanopening where hesaw
afat girl. Shehad redpaint onher dress. Coyote asked her,
"Why areyou sitting there?" Allsheanswered was,"Uuu!"
Shecould notsayanything else. Coyote then thought hewould
take heralong. "Must Icarry youonmyback?" heasked. Her
reply was,"Eee!"Helifted herup;andwhen hewasready to
putherdown, hesaidtoher,"Let go!Here isagood place tostop."
The girl,however, only tightened herhold until shechoked Coyote.
Sherecognized him,andthrew himintotheriver. Hefloated down
thestream until hecame toMagpie, who revived him asbefore.
Coyote saidtohim,"What areyouwaking meupfor,justasIwas
getting thegirls?" Magpie toldhim,"That wasaleech. Shehas
been there always. When yougoback, shewillbethere. Askher
ifshe iscold,andshewillsay,'Eee!'Thenmake abig fire,takea
stick, andburn her." Coyote said,"That isjustwhat Ihave been
thinking," Hewent up,reached thewoman, andsaid toher,"My
cousin, Iseeyouare stillhere. Areyounotcold sitting inthespring?"
—"Eee!"washeranswer. Hegathered aload ofwood andmade
abig fire.Then hepulled hertoward it,andwithalong stickpushed
her in.When shetried tocrawl out,hepushed herbackand killed
her.Then hesaid,"Your name shall beLeech. Sometimes you
willgetontochildren andcrawl intothem, butnotmany willdie
fromyour bites. Good people arecoming, andyou shall notharm
them."
ThatwastheendofCoyote's j.ourney.
{Second Version.)
After Coyote hadcutthechannels inthefalls(probably atDalles),
hewent east,andfound that allthepeople hadcrossed themountains
intothebuffalo country. Sohefollowed them. Aftersome timehe
came toaplace where adogwasbarking.^ Ayoung woman stood
near by.When shesawCoyote, sheshouted, "Come here,andshoot

gethim.Come here, and Iwillshowhim toyou." Coyote went
upcloser, andleaned over the cliff tosee.Then shepushed him
over with aforked stick thatshehad inherhand, and killed him.
Sherandown and said,"Why, that isCoyote!" Shedragged him
down totheriverandthrew him in,andtookupherformer place.
Itwasherhabit tokillpeople inthisway.
Coyote floated downstream until hewascaught some distance
below. Magpie came along andbegan topeck athiseyes, thus
waking him up.Coyote said,"What areyou doing, you rascal?
Iwasdreaming. Why didyounotleavemealone?" Magpie
answered, "Nonsense! Thatyoung woman isalways killing people.
Shehas killed you. Theonly thing todo istoborrow herstick
when shecallsyouagain. Then askherwhere tostand; andwhen
shebends over toshow you,push heroverand killher."
Coyote wentupthe trail. Hereached theplacewhere thedogwas
barking, andtheyoung woman called him asbefore. Hewent to
her. This time, however, hedidasMagpie toldhim,andpushed her
over. She fellhalfway,andthen started tofly.Coyote sawthat
shewastheButterfly. Hetoldherthat thereafter shewas tobe
only acommon butterfly, andthat children were toplaywith her.
Coyote went on.Soon hemetawoman onthe trail. They sat
down together. Coyote toldherthathewasfollowing thepeople.
Sheasked Coyote whether hehadanything inwhich tocarry food,
forthen shewould givehimsome. Coyote spread hisblanket, and
sheuntied herbundle. Sheputsomething inhisblanket andwent
on.When hewasgone, helooked atwhat shehadgiven him,and
found that hisblanket was fulloflice. Coyote jumped upandshook
them out. Then, afterwashing theblanket inthecreek, hewent on.
Soon hemetanother woman. They satdown, andthewoman
offered togivehimfood. Hespread hisblanket. Sheputsomething
into itandwent on.When heopened hisblanket, hefound the
woman's excrements in it.Herantothecreek, washed it,and
went on.
This happened four times. The fifth timewhen thewoman
promised him food, hehesitated, but finally spread hisblanket for
hercontribution. When helooked, hefound that shehadgiven
himdried buffalo-meat. Heatesomeandranasquickly ashecould,
trying tohead her off.Hesatdown onthe trail tomake herthink
hewasanother person. Hesaid toher,"Did youmeetanybody on
thetrail?"—"Yes," shereplied. "Not farfrom here there aresome
more people," said Coyote. "They alllook likeme.They are

wasgone, heranonover the hillandheaded heroffasbefore. This
happened fourtimes. The lasttimeshepassed himwithout stopping.
Coyote followed her,struck herwith arock, and killed her.Then
allthemeat disappeared, notonlywhat shehad,butalsoCoyote's
caches. Hewasdiscouraged, andwent on.

After receiving advice, hesays,"That isjustwhat Ithought ofdoing."
Themonster became awoodworm.

Coyote continued histravels upthe river, andmetamanwith

spoke tohim, buttheman didnotanswer. Hekeptoncatching
fish,which hestrung up.Coyote asked himforafish,buthisrequest
wasrefused. Heasked asecond time,and thistime themanmocked
him, repeating Coyote's words: "Give meone." After awhile the
man started tofordtheriver. Coyote, whowasvery angry, threw
arock athim, hithislegs,andbroke them. Theman floated down
theriver; andCoyote called after him,"Your loadwastooheavy
andbroke your legs!" Theman repeated thewords after him. As
hewassinking, Coyote spoke again; butwhen theman tried toanswer,
allthat could beseenwere bubbles onthesurface ofthewater.
Coyote said,"Henceforth you shallbeacrane (mu'k'a), andpeople
shallmake funofyou. Fromnow on,when aman killsmuch game,
heshall giveothers some."
8.TheEye-Juggler,^
Coyote was travelling, andheard some onesinging, "Come back,

back, and itdropped back into itssocket. "Now Icandoit,"he
said tohimself. Wildcat heard him, and,knowing itwasCoyote,
took hishorn (kapatkd'x), and,when Coyote threw hiseyeupagain,
heknocked itoutoftheway, sothat itdidnotreturn. Coyote called
several times, buttheeyedidnotcome back. Coyote now said,
"My eyemust benear. IfItakeouttheother one,they willboth
come back tome." Sohetook itoutandthrew itup.Bothcame
back. "That's afine trick," Coyote said.Now hethrew both at
thesame time. This timeWildcat knocked both away, andCoyote
became totally blind.
Here follows thestory oftheorigin oftheElbow-Baby (Katsainomiats).
Themanwhose eyes hetears out cries, "Ane, ane!" andbecomes thecat-
bird (awexuox).
When Coyote came toatent,hefound anoldwoman living there.
Helistened outside, andheard hersingabout Coyote's eyes. "It is
agood thing helost hiseyes," shesang. Coyote thenwent in,and
sawthewoman grinding seeds. Sheground them very fine."What
areyou singing about?" Coyote asked. "Coyote lost hiseyes,"
she said. "That iswhy Iamsinging. People aregathered here
from allover, dancing about Coyote's eyes.Mygrand-daughters
have gone there. They willcome back tomesoon." Thewoman
thengavesome seeds toCoyote, who said tohimself, "Imust killthis
oldwoman." Toherhesaid, "Imust gooutaminute." With
thathewent outtogettwostones. When hereturned, hesaid,"I
amgladCoyote lost hiseyes." Then hehitheronthehead witha
stone and killed her.Hetook hisknifeandskinned her.Thebody
hehidoutside. Allthemealandseeds hecooked and ate.Then he
putonherskinandclothes andassumed hershape. ^Hekepton
pounding themealandseeds until towards evening heheard anoise.
Theoldest daughter came in,then thenextyounger, andtheothers in
order, theyoungest onecoming last. Shelooked atCoyote andrecog-
nized him. Shedecided thathehad killed hergrandmother. The
other girls said tohim,"You arenotgrinding theseeds properly.
Themeal ismuch toocoarse."—"My legshurt," answered Coyote.
"Iwasshot inthethigh alongtime ago,and ithurts sothat Icannot
domuch pounding now."
Soon after thisthegirlswentback intothetent, and,being tired,
went tosleep. Coyote went over tothem andputhishand onthe
privates ofthefour elder girls. Asheapproached theyoungest, she
awoke andkicked him. Sheknew hewasCoyote, andasked him,
"What areyoudoing?" Atthistheother girlsawoke, too,and
rebuked herforacting sotoward hergrandmother.
Thefollowing daythey said toher,"Grandmother, theywantyou
atthedance todance about Coyote." Coyote replied, "Iamso

said. The oldest onecarried him first. She lifted himonherback.
Coyote then toldhertoraiseupherdress and lethim slidedown
lower onherback. With that she felthimtouch her,anddropped
him.Totheothers shesaid, "Ididnotmean todrop her." The
nextonetried tocarry him,andthesame thing happened; andso
with allfour ofthem. Then they toldtheyoungest thatshemustdo
hershare. Sherefused, however, sotheoldest tried again. When
they reached the hillandcould seethehouses. Coyote said, "Ican
walkfrom hereon."
When they arrived attheplace, theyheard aloud noise andsaw
thepeople dancing. There wasanother Coyote atthecamp. This
one,when hecaught sight ofthem, called out,"The oldwoman is
coming todance with us!"Thedisguised Coyote began todance and
sing,andforgot allabout hislameness. "Where areCoyote's eyes?
Letmehavethem!" hesaid. "Let herhavethem!" some onesaid.
Thepeople crowded together andmade room forhertodance. As
soon ashehadhiseyes, hetookouttheother onesandputback his
own. Then hetook offhisdisguise andranaway. The people
wondered atfirst. Then theysawtheyhadbeen deceived, and
pursued him. Foxcaught upwithhim. Coyote then scattered some
oftheblack paint thathehad,and itgrew dark.^ Thepursuers lost
theirway, while Coyote satonahillalittleway off.When itcleared,
they gave chase again. Coyote eluded them, asbefore. This
happened fivetimes. Atlasttheygrewweary andgaveupthechase.
SoCoyote gothiseyesback. Later onhewentbackandgavenames
tothechildren ofthegirlswhom hehaddeceived.
9.TheRival Suitors.^
Coyote wastheleading man inacertain village. Eagle wasthe
second inrank. There weretwobrothers who livedsome distance
away. They were great hunters andvery wealthy. They were
honored byall,butpreferred tolivebythemselves. Theolder one
wasmarried. HisnamewasWalaetitsa, hiswife'sname was Ti'pti'-

(xd'txdte). Shewas inlovewith theyounger brother, who, however,
paidnoattention toher.Onedaytheyounger man said tohis
brother, "My arrows arebroken, Iwant togetsomewood forshafts.
Youmay gohunting alone to-day." Sotheelder brother setout
byhimself. Theyounger onecutsticks, made several arrows, and
putthem near the firetodry.^ While hewasworking, hissister-in-

coaxed him;and finally hewent out,shot thebirdwith abroken
arrow, andthrew itather, saying, "There isthebird.What do
youwant itfor?" Then hewent in.
Soon hecame outagain tocutmore arrow-sticks. While hewas
gone, hissister-in-law went inandscratched herfacewith theclaws
ofthebird. Then shelaydown. Theyoung man's dogsawthewhole
performance. When herhusband came home andsawherlying
there, heasked, "What ailsyou?" Shedidnotanswer, andhe
asked again. Finally shereplied impatiently, "Seewhatyour brother
hasdone tome!Hetried toforce me;andwhen Iresisted, he
scratched myface." The grizzly-bear doglaythere andwatched,
andheard everything. Themanturned around, and, seeing theboy's
arrows, broke themandthrew them intothe fire.
Theyoungmannowcame inandasked, "Where aremyarrows?"
Nooneanswered, andheasked asecond time. Still there wasno
answer. Then hesawtheends inthe fire. Finally hisbrother spoke,
and said,"Soyoudidnotwant togoouthunting thismorning, did
you? Youwanted toforceyour sister-in-law." Theboygotupand
took hisbowandarrows,^ andwent out. Hisdogfollowed him.^
Heleftthehouse andwandered offonhistravels. Hecrossed five
mountains. The fifthmountain wasvery high. Here heundressed,
and told thedogtostaybelow andwait, while heclimbed atree.
Heclimbed higher andhigher until hewasoutofsight.^ Thedog

said,"Odog!where isyourmaster?" Thedogdidnotanswer, but

happen?" Thedog said, "Iwaslying outside, andheard your wife
callingmymaster toshoot abird," andheproceeded togivean
account ofeverything thathadtaken place,—howshehadscratched
herown face,andhow hismaster haddonenowrong. "Ifthat isso,"
Walaetitsa said,"Ishall leaveyouhere asagrizzly bear. You shall
killpeople when youmust, butnotalways. Ishall gohome and
killmywife, andthen gotothevillage tolive." With thatthey
parted.
Walaetitsa approached hishome, andsaw hiswifeoutside dressing
askin. Hedrew hisbowandarrow andaimed ather. "Areyou
going toshootme?" sheasked him, laughing. Hedidnotanswer,
butmerely drew hisbowandkilled her.^ Then hewent intothehouse,
swallowed allhisfine things, andwent tothevillage. Walaetitsa
wasarather largeman ;butwhen hehadswallowed allthose things,
hebecame very small andextremely ugly. Heand hisbrother had
been thebest-looking men inthevillage.
Hewent tothevillage,^ andcame tothe firstwater-hole intheice.
Hewasalmost naked. Some young girjswere there drawing water.
When theysawhim, they asked, "Who areyou, littleboy?" He
answered, "IamWalaetitsa." Atthisthey laughed and scoffed.
"You dolook likeWalaetitsa," they said. Then theywentonhome.

entitled toonlyoneofthem.
Walaetitsa wasplaying outside with his littlebowandarrow.
Theyoungmenshotatthefeathers, butnone could hitthem. Coyote
wasthere looking on. Intheafternoon Walaetitsa passed by;and
Coyote saidtohim, "Little boy,shoot atthose feathers." Walaetitsa
aimed atthem, butdidnotshoot. Hecontinued toplayandjump
about. Coyote said again, "Shoot atthem." Thereupon theboy
didshoot, andknocked down firstoneandthen theother. Coyote
shot atthesame time,andclaimed that itwas hisarrow that hitthe
feathers. Theby-standers, however, testified thattheboyhadbeen
victorious. Assoon ashehad hitthem, theboyrantohisgrand-
mother's tent.
Eagle called hisdaughters, and said,"You heardmypromise.
Now, goandbethewives oftheboy." They setout,theelder onein

andsawthedirty littleboyjumping about inside. Shesaid toher

theboyjumped aside, andsaid tohisgrandmother, "What does that

answered. With thattheboycrawled into hisgrandmother's blanket

Raven hadtold hiswife tobring himwater too.Thetwo sisters

Raven hadgoneahead andpicked upthebuffalo-heads. Hehad
given these tohiswifetotake toherfather. While Eaglewasexamin-

ofthemeat. She said toherfather, "Throw those heads away,"
andshecarried them outside. Asshedid so,shemether sister
coming with another head. When thelatter sawwhat wasbeing
donewith hercontribution, shegrewangry andwent away.^
AtthattimeRaven controlled theanimals.^ Hewasveryangry
because hisfather-in-law didnotaccept theheads hehad sent.He
leftthevillage with hiswife,andtook allthegame-animals with him.^
Afamine ensued. Walaetitsa wastheonlyonewhocould getmeat.
AtlastRaven visited them tosee iftheywere starving. They tried
tocatch him,butwere unsuccessful because hewassowhite. When

place where thebuffaloes were. Walaeititsa killed anumber, andtook thebest ofthe
meat. The chief toldthewomen togoandmeet thehunters with water. Walaeititsa
told thiswifetomakesomewater white with clay forhim. Raven told hiswifetoprepare
adrink forhimwith finecoal. Thewomen metthehunters ontheridge. They could see
Walaeititsa alongway off,because hewasdressed sowell. Raven's wife,when shesaw

Theyounger answered, "No,Raven isyourhusband, andyoumaykeephim." Bythis

Finally Beaver devised aplan. Hetold thepeople tocuthim

suspicious, and said,"You aremaking believe youaredead." He
staid nearbyforatime, but finally decided thatBeaver wasdead.
"Well, youaredead, after all,"hesaid,"and Iwilltasteyour fat."

hesaid. They conferred together, butdidnotknow what todo.
Finally Walaetitsa said, "Iwillgowith Grass-Snake (k''"uimk''^ttim)

BythistimeRaven and hiswifehadadaughter. When Raven
came backfrom hisvisit tohisformer neighbors, hemoved hiscamp.
Hetold hislittle girl,"Ifeveryougototheoldcamping-place, and
you findanything there, don't pick itup." Onemorning the girl
went back andfound alittle dog. Walaetitsa hadturned himself
intoadog,andGrass-Snake hadbecome aroot-digger {tu'kds). The
girlpicked upthepup, themortar, andtheroot-digger, andhidthem
near her tent. Her parents asked her ifshehadseen anything.

When they arrived there, Deer saidtohiswife, "Build afireandheat

andherhusband Deer tocomeandseehim thenext day. Then he
andhisboy left.
NextdayCoyote's daughter andherhusband came. Coyote said

andmy son-in-law's excrements?" They continued cooking the
dung, which turned intocanvas-back duck. When they took the
stick out, itproved tobeanintestine filled withmeat, sothey ate it.
Coyote said,"Come and visitusto-morrow!"
^Raven's little girlcame outtothem, andtheysawhercoming. Themortar androot-

Coyote's wife,andsetting firetoher. Sheranout.Then Elkand
hiswifeprepared thefoodandwenthome indisgust. Coyote ate

five sticks were allready. Coyote told hiswife togetthesticks,
since heneeded them. "What areyougoing todowiththem?"
asked hiswife. "You don'tknowhow tousethem." Coyote took
thesticks andclimbed thetree.Hewhistled, justasKingfisher had

however, helanded ontheiceandalmost killed himself. Hissonwas
watching him,andcalled out,"My father hasfallendown ontheice!"
Kingfisher carried himhome. Then hetook thesticks, flewupinto
thetree, dived, andcaught fishforCoyote. Then indisgust hewent
home, after telling Coyote's wife toputwater onCoyote's headand
cure him. Coyote awoke with abandage around hishead. That
wasbecause smart Coyote wastrying togetthebest ofeverybody.
When Coyote gotwell, hewent toseehisson-in-law, Elk. Elk
asked hiswife,"What arewegoing toeat?" Hecutasharp stick,

wasbusy withsome other work: therefore hegotthepotready and
heated thestones. Then hetook hisknifeandcutapiece offhiswife's
dress, which wasvery old."Why areyoudoing that?" shecried.
Coyote continued tocut it,asElkhaddone, andproceeded tocut

gather wild-rose berries. Hewould sharethem with Fox,whom he
gave only afew,however, saying thathehadnotbeen able toget
many. Coyote used towatch Fox,andevery evening hewould see
him eating. Once hejumped athim,andasked, "What areyou
eating?"—"Oh, salmon," was thereply. Coyote asked, "Where
didyougetthem?" Foxrefused totell,butfinally Coyote persuaded
him. Foxexplained thathehadfound alogwith pitch onit,thathe
had split offafewpieces, thrown them backward, andthat thesehad
become dried salmon. When Coyote heard this,hesaidthathewas

Theday after. Coyote went outasusual formice and berries.
Foxwent outandmade some traps. Hesetthem andcaught some
rabbits. Hecooked them andgave one toCoyote. "Where did
you catch that?" asked Coyote. "Never mind!" said Fox. At
last,however, Coyote prevailed uponhimtogivehimtheinformation.
Foxtoldhim,"After you left, Iwentuptotherose-bushes where the
rabbit-tracks are. Isatdown andtook several thorns."—"Then
what?" asked Coyote. "Never mind!" saidFox. "Oh, tellme!"
persisted Coyote. "Well," saidFox, "Masturbatus sumatque spinas
milei inpenem infixi. Then, when theblood came, andtherabbits
smelt itandrushed in, Icaught several."—"Oh! Icandothat
better thanyou," saidCoyote, "Iamstrong."
Sonextmorning hewent outanddidasFoxhad said. Onerabbit
came, andheate it.Then herepeated theprocess untilhewassorely
exhausted andcould notmove. Atlasthewent home. "You old
fool!" Fox said tohim, "Idon't dothat. Ijustmade traps and
caught therabbits thatway."—"Ithought so,"Coyote said, ashe
laythere suffering.
Nextmorning Foxwentdown the trail totheriver. Hedropped
histailintothecreek; andwhen hedrew itforth, there weremany
roots attached toit.Hedidthisseveral times, andthen carried the
roots home. Old-Coyote watched Fox,andwondered what hewas
eating. Hepestered Fox until thelatter atlasttoldhim,"Iwent
down andgotintothe riffle. Istuckmy tailinwhere theicewas
running; andwhen Ipulled itout, Idrew these roots outwith it."—
"Icandothat allday," saidCoyote.
Sothenextmorning Coyote wentandfound theplace. Hestuck
histailinanddrew outafewroots, which hepromptly ate.Then

home."—"Well, that's what Iwasthinking," saidCoyote.
After several days, Coyote said,"Here wearegetting hungry.
Now, Ihave aplan."—"What isit?"asked Fox. "Well," said
Coyote, "there isavillage withmany people. Wecanscarethem
away and liveontheplunder forayear. There isanoldwoman on
thissidethatwecan kill.Thenwecanstuff her,and Icanwear her
onmyhead andsofrighten thepeople. Youcangoahead ona
message."
They killed thewoman andthought that shelooked dreadful

enough tofrighten thepeople. When theywere near thevillage,
Coyote said toFox,"Now, goahead withyour message! Cry out,
'There isaterrible monster coming! Should anyonehear itsvoice,
thatperson willsurely sicken and die.Theonlyway tosaveyour-
selves istorunaway. Iamtheonlyonethat issafe,because Ican
outrun him. There he isnow! Look athim!'" Fox carried out
hisinstructions tothe letter. Thepeople were frightened andran
away. Foxranonahead andhidhimself. Later hecame back,and
found thatCoyote hadalready taken allthebestplunder. The latter
saidtohim, "Itoldyouweshould scare allthepeople. Inafewdays
wewillgotoanother village."
Thegrand-daughter oftheoldwoman whom theyhad killed lived
inthesecond village theywere going tovisit. They started for it,as
before. Foxagain gave thewarning; buttheyoungwoman didnot
run, forsheknewwhat Coyote andFoxhaddone. Shewaited until
theycame. Then shegotupandtook hergrandmother away from
Coyote.
That istheend.
Oncewhen Coyote lived with Fox,hesaid tohim,"Let usgoto
thevillage andrunaracewith thepeople! You areagood runner,
andweshall win. Ishalldothetalking, andwewillrace for life.
Ifwewin,wewillcuttheir throats; and ifthey beat us,theymay
cutours. You aresafe inany case, fornoanimal canoutrun you."—"All right!" saidFox. They arrived atthevillage, andannounced
thattheyhadcome toracetheDeer boys, andthatthewinners should
cut offtheheads ofthe losers. The fiveDeer boys raced Coyote
andFox,andthelatter won. They killed thefivedeer. Coyote took
thethree older ones,andFoxthetwoyounger ones.
Thenextdaytheywent totheMountain-Sheep, and thesame
happened. They cutofftheheads oftheMountain-Sheep, andCoyote
again took thelion's share. The thirddaythey raced theElkboys,
andbeatthem inthesame manner. Thefourth daythey tried the
white-tailed Deerandbeatthem. The fifthdayCoyote said,"Let
usrunagainst theMagpie boys!"—"No," saidFox,"they will
beat us."—"Of course, youcanbeatthem," Coyote assured him.
"No Icannot," Fox insisted. "Besides, they areofnousetous,
even ifwedowin."—"Why, wewant their feathers," saidCoyote.
"Iknow Icannot beatthem," persisted Fox.
Nevertheless they didracewith theMagpies, andwere beaten.
Coyote hidhimself near thecreek. Some littleboyswhowere playing
there cried, "Oh, seeCoyote hiding inthebushes!" TheMagpies had
already killed Fox. They found Coyote, whose nosewassticking out
ofthewater. They dragged himoutandcuthisthroat.^

Coyote became aspirit. Whenever anywoman came out to
urinate oracouple tocohabit, hewould callthembyname. They
grew tired ofthis,and finally resuscitated him. After thisCoyote
went offbyhimself. Hecame totheplace where Polecat and his
sister were living. Hesuggested toPolecat thatheplay sick.^ "Then
your sistermust goand callintheDeer brothers toseeyou.When
theycome in,youcan killthem withyour stick."—"All right!"
said Polecat. Coyote then told Polecat's sister tofollow theDeer's
trail,andwhen shecame nearthem tocallout,"Mybrother isnearly
deadandwants toseehisfriends!" Shestarted out;andastheDeer
came by,shecried, andsaidwhat Coyote hadinstructed hertosay.
TheDeer said,"We willcome soon." The sister thenranhome and
announced that theDeer were coming. Polecat played sick,and
Coyote stepped outandsaidtotheDeer,"Go inandseeyour friend!
This isthelasttimeyou willseehim." The fiveDeerwent in,and
Polecat turned looseand killed them. Coyote cutupthemeat; and
after thatwasgone, they didthesame totheWhite-Tailed Deer.
The sister, whose namewasVirgin {k^adetstlmdi) ,went outtomeet
them. "What isthematter?" they asked. Shetoldthem andthen
ranhome. Polecat wasready forthem, andCoyote stood outside as
before. Hespoke tothem ashehaddone totheothers. When they
entered. Polecat killed them. Coyote heard Polecat call, sohewent
onandbutchered theDeer.
After thatCoyote said,"Let uskilltheMountain-Sheep!" So
they tried that. The sister played thesame part asbefore. Every-
thing happened asontheprevious occasions. Coyote was outside,
andaddressed them inthesame manner; andPolecat killed them
ashehadtheothers.
Next Coyote proposed trying theElk.Hetold thesister togo
andwaitontheir trail. Shedideverything just asshehaddone
previously. Theyoungest Elk saidhehadsomething withwhich
tokillthem. They talked tothegirljustastheformer victims had
done. Theyoungest, however, toldhisbrothers allthathadhappened,
andthat theonlyway togetridofPolecat was forhim totake the
lead. "Ihave onlyoneantler, andmust take itoff,anyway. Iwill
killhimwith that," hesaid.
Theycame toPolecat's tent,andPolecat gotready. Coyote spoke
asbefore. TheElks, though, hadeverything arranged. Theyoungest
onepassed theothers, andasPolecat raised histail,heranhimthrough
with hisantler. Then Elkranoutofthetent.When thesister and
Coyote sawthePolecat sticking onElk's antler, they could nothelp
laughing. Finally Elkbeat Polecat against astump, and lefthim.
Hissister andCoyote came, andfound himdead.

12.Coyote kills theMoon.^
TheMoon andhissonHved together. Theboyused tohunt people
justaswearehunting fordeer. Hetook thebodies home totheold
man,whoatethetesticles ofallthementheboy killed. Coyote heard
ofthis,anddecided tokillhim. Oneday,when theboywasout
hunting, Coyote stoleupfrom behind, andsaid,"This isnottheplace
youarelooking for. Follow me,and Iwillshowyouwhere Iused to
hunt. Your father ismybrother." TheMoon boydidnotknow
what tosay. Coyote said tohim,"Weused tobuild afirenear here.
Iwillshowyoutheplace. There isafinespring nearby." Coyote
said this, and, lo!there wasaspring. Heguided theMoon there,
andshowed him thespring, which wasexceedingly cold. Coyote
said,"Iamvery thirsty. Where isyourtent?" Moon's sonpointed
itout."What doyoutake totheoldmanwhen yougohome?" he
asked. Moon's sonreplied, "Igivehim testicles; heeatsthem."
Moon's soncarried theclubwithwhich heused tokillpeople. Coyote
said tohim,"Drink while Ilook atyour club!" Then, astheyouth
stooped over. Coyote killed himwith hisown club. Coyote stripped
himandputonhisclothes.^ "Ilook just likehim," hesaid. Coyote
carried arawhide sack, intowhich heputthebody oftheyouth. It
began togrow dark justashereached Moon's house. Heentered,
andsawagreat fatoldman. Thehousewas filledwith fineornaments.
Theoldmanuntied thepackandatehisown son's testicles. "They
donottaste very good," hesaid; "they aretoostrong." Coyote
decided toleave thehouse thatnightandtakewithhimtheornaments
hesaw.Heatesome oftheflesh oftheMoon's son,butsoonthrew
itaside. Then helaydown andwaited fortheoldman togotosleep.
Soon heslept soundly. Hedidnotevenawaken when Coyote
coughed. Coyote thentook theornaments andprepared toleave.*
Hewent asfarasthedoor. Itwasevening, andhewould have to
travel allnight. Hewasvery tired, however, sohedecided torest
awhile andgoonlater. Heplaced theornaments atthehead ofhis
bed,andsoon fellasleep. The oldman awoke, andsawCoyote
lying near thedoor. Coyote hadnoteven passed through thering
around themoon. Hetoldtheoldman thathehadwalked inhis
sleepandthathewasfeeling very sick. Thethirddayhetried again,
but stillhecould notgetout,hecould notgetfarther than the
door. Finally theoldmandecided that thiswasnothisson.Hesaid
toCoyote, "You have killedmysonandbrought mehisbody toeat.
Ithought soatthetime.Why didyou killhim?" Coyote said to
him, "Henceforth you shall beagoodmoon andnot killpeople.
They willknow you,andyou shall begood tothem. Themoon

hereafter." TheMoon agreed, and toldhim togo.Hegavehim
clothes andpresents andsenthimaway. The oldman toldhim,
"Itisdaytime now,andyoucantravel far." Then Coyote travelled,
having firstputthemoon inthesky. Thus Coyote killed theMoon
boy.
(Second Version.)
Coyote wastravelling inthewest. Heheard thatMoon wasliving
intheeast.When theMoon cameupinthemorning, itwassohot
thateverything wasburnt and allthepeople were killed. Inthose
dayswhat isnowthemoon wasthesun. Coyote travelled toMoon's
tent, forhehadheard thatMoon hadasonwhowent about killing
allthepeople hemet.
When Coyote finally mettheyouth, hetoldhimthat therewasa
finespring onthemountain fromwhich hisgrandfather always used
todrinkwhen hewasouthunting. Coyote hadcreated thespring by
means ofmagic, andtherefore Moon's sondidnotknow ofit.Infact,
hedidnotbelieve what Coyote toldhim.Hesaid tohimself, "I
wonder whether Coyote istelling thetruth about thespring!" Still
hewent withhim.Onthewaytheypassed many people, andMoon's
sonkilled them all.Hetook nothing buttheir testicles togive to
hisfather. When they finally reached afinespring, hebelieved what
Coyote had toldhim. Coyote suggested thatthey taste thewater.
HetoldMoon's sontodrink first,showed himwhere itwas coldest,
andasked himtolethimhold histomahawk while hewasdrinking.
Moon consented, andwhile hewasdrinking. Coyote killed himwith
histomahawk. After thatheputtheclaws and testicles ofthedead
manonhimself. Bytheuseofmagic hemade himself look just like
Moon's son.Then heproceeded toMoon's house.
When hearrived there, hegave theoldman thetesticles, justas
hissonused todo.Theoldmanwasvery glad togetthem. While
hewaseating, hesaid toCoyote, "These testicles taste alittle bitter,
itisthe firsttime Ihave eaten thiskind."
Coyote lived there forsome time, andMoon didnotdiscover his
identity. Hetried tostealsome ofMoon's best-loved property.
Oneevening whenMoon was asleep, hetook itandstarted towards
thedoor. Hetravelled allnight; butwhen morning came, hefound
thathehadonlyreached asfarasthedoor ofthetent.WhenMoon
awoke andsawCoyote, whom hesupposed tobehisson,lying near
thedoor, hegrew suspicious, andwondered what thetrouble was,
forhissonhadnever acted thatway before.
Thepeople toldCoyote thathewould nevermake hisescape from
Moon's tent. The following night Coyote bothered Moon tosee if
hecould wake him.When hefound thatMoon wassound asleep,

hetook hisfiveknives andbegan tocutoffMoon's head. Four of
theknives broke; the fifth one,however, completed theoperation.
Then hesaid toMoon, "You shall killnomore people. You shall
benothing butthemoon. TheIndians willcome andlook atyou."
13.TheBears.^
Onceupon atime therewere fivemen^and fiveGrizzly-Bear girls.
There was alsoaBlack-Bear whohadasonandadaughter. The
oldestmanhadmarried thedaughter ofBlack-Bear. Thisangered the
Grizzly-Bears, astheywanted themen forthemselves. Theybecame
soenraged thatthey resolved tokillthemen. They danced, andas
they did so,blood spurted forth from their mouths. They said,
"When spring comes, weshall killthem."
One day,when theoldest manwent hunting, hesawawoman
digging roots inacanyon. When sheheldupherhead, hesawthat
shewasgood-looking. Shehadahighcrown onherhat,andwas
beautifully dressed andpainted. Herhairwas long. Hewalked up
thecanyon toward her,wondering who shemight be.Shewas
really theoldest Grizzly-Bear girl. Sheasked theman tocome near.
Asheapproached her,shebecame awild grizzly bear. Sheseized
himandbroke hisneck. Onthefollowing day,when hisbrothers
went tolook forhim,theyfound hisbody withbroken neck. Inthe
sameway theGrizzly-Bears killed four ofthemenandtook their
heads totheir den.
TheBlack-Bear's sonknew allthathappened. Hisfather accused
him ofhaving killed hisbrothers-in-law. "You saythewrong things
when you sing while you aredancing,"^hesaid tohim. They
danced, andtheboysang, saying thathewould killthefirstbearthat
came out.Hesang thewrong words. The oldBear said,"Goand
look foryour brother-in-law." The girlthen toldhimthat fourhad
been killed, andonlyonewas left.Theyoung bearandtheboy
were ofthesame size. "Let usgoandseethem," theman said.
"No, don't come! Letmegoalone," theboy replied, "for ifthey

Grizzly-Bear woman digging roots. Asheapproached her,sheinvited
himtootocomeupand talk. Theboyhadbeenwarned toshoot

'Itappears from Dr.Spinden's version (JAFL 21-:152)that theGrizzly-Bears used
aformula forkilling their enemies, which waschanted while theywere dancing. The
Black-Bear boytheninduced them tousewrong words intheir formula. Thus hewas

Thechildren werenow allalone. They cried allnight long. They

andtheboyseized herarmsanddragged her off.Theothers tried
torescue her,butwere unsuccessful. Then they sentword toThunder,
telling himthatoneofhiswives hadbeen stolen.
When Thunder heard this,hemade ready topursue Rabbit. He
painted himself, andathunder-clap washeard. Then hewentup
into theclouds, thundering allthetime. Theboywashastening
away. Thethunder-cloud stood right overhim,andaterrific storm
raged. The lightning struck everywhere. Theabducted woman

16.TheOrigin ofDeath.
Coyote's married daughter wasaccidentally burned todeath. Her
husband moved away, and leftCoyote alone. One night, asCoyote
wassleeping, hisdaughter cameandtalked tohim. "Ihave justcome
toseeyou," shesaid."Iamgoing ontowhere thedead people live.
Youcannot gowith us,because youare alive, andwearedead."
Coyote saidthathewould follow her."You cancome along ifyou
throw yourself intothefire," thegirltoldhim. Coyote threw himself
intotheflames; butassoon ashefeltthepain, hejumped outagain.
Hewas sobadly blistered, however, that hisdaughter allowed him
togoalong. "You willnever seeusagain," shetoldhim,"butyou
willhear uslater. There isnothing toeatonthe trail. Youmust
stickyourhand inyourmouth. That willsatisfy you."
The girlledtheway,andCoyote followed hervoice. Itoften led
him intorocks and trees. There wasthenoise oflaughter ahead of
him,andCoyote followed thesound. Though itwasdaylight. Coyote
could seenothing. They talked onlywhen evening came, andthen
Coyote would follow thesound. They travelled forfivedays. At
theendofthattimeCoyote could almost seethem. Infivedaysmore
theywould belikepeople tohim.
When they finally arrived attheland ofthedead, they feared they
would have tobarhimfrom it,because hewas alive. Theymade
him sleep atsome distance from theothers. Theland ofthedead
wasvery close tothesea. Allabout himCoyote saw allkinds ofeggs.
They gavehimabag fullofholes inwhich togather eggs. Hefilled

thebag,andsawthat alltheeggs fellthrough theholes. Therefore
hedidnoteven tie itup.When hecame back tohisdaughter, he
hadnothing atall.The girlthen said tohim,"Next time fillupthe
bag; andeven ifitfalls together, asifthere were nothing init,be
sure totieitup.Then itwillbefull."—"That iswhat Ithought,"
replied Coyote. Hewent back togather more eggs. He filled the
bagandtied itup.Hethrew itonhisback, but itseemed asthough
there were nothing init.Soon, however, itgrew heavy; andwhen
hereached thehouse, itwasquite full. Henceforth itbecame his
duty togather eggs.
Though heheard people talk, hecould notseethem. Hewould
laugh over their jokes, andtheywould talkabout him. They said
thattheywould putthemselves intoabag,which hewas tocarry
home. When theywere ready, they toldhimtostart. Hetravelled
over fivemountains. The girlsaid tohim, "Father, nowweare
going home. Four ofthemountains willbeeasy toclimb, butthe
fifthonewillbehard. You willhardly beable toclimb it,butdo
notunder anycircumstances open your pack. When youhave
reached theother sideofthelastmountain, untie thebundle, andthere
willbepeople init.When later others die,they toowillcome back
inalittle while." Coyote promised nottountie thebag. "Imay
beable tocross themountains intwodays," hesaid.Hethrew the
packonhisbackandstarted onhisjourney. This timehehada
little foodwithhim.Hecrossed three mountains, andtheloadbegan
togetheavy. Heheard thepeople laugh and talk,andhewasvery
glad. Hecrossed thefourth mountain, andnow therewasonlyone
more toclimb. Hestarted toclimb it,andmanaged togetwithin
afewfeetofthetop.Hewasvery tired, stillheforced himself togo
about four feetmore, butthatwasasfarashecould go.Though he
hadonlyabout sixfeettotravel, heopened hispack. Those inthe
pack then said tohim, "Father, nowwemust goback, andyou will
have togohome. Henceforth when people die,they willbedead
forever." Then Coyote cried, and said,"Ishall notbetheonlyone
tomourn achild. Allpeople shalldothesame asI.When aperson
dies,they shallnever seehimagain." Thus hesaid,andwenthome.

Coyote tolookoverthe cliffandseehowbesttheycould getatMoun-
tain-Sheep; andwhile hewasdoing this,shecaught hisneckwith the
forked stickandpushed himoverthe cliff.Then shewentdownwhere

shethrew thebody intotheriver.
Coyote floated down theriver abend andahalf,andstranded.
Magpie came flying uptheriver; andwhen hesawCoyote, hethought
tohimself, "Iwonder ifthere ismatter inhiseyes!" When Magpie
began pecking attheeyes ofCoyote, however, thelattercame to,and
said toMagpie, "Why areyouflying around here? Imyself have just
been tobattle, capturing women." Magpie replied, "You were in
nobattle; youwere pushed over the cliffand killed byMountain-
Sheep Girl." ThenMagpie toldCoyote what todotoplayeven.
SoCoyote travelled upstream asecond time, andagain heheard
hercall.Hewentuptoher;andwhen sheasked himtodothesame

justwhere Ihave tostand inorder toseeMountain-Sheep plainly."
When shewent toshow him.Coyote caught herwith theforked stick,

Then Coyote resumed hisjourney upriver; andbyandbyheheard

2,TheBungling Host.^
One ofCoyote's daughters hadmarried anElk,oneaMountain-

When Coyote gottothehouse, theywent inandsatthere fora

saidtoMountain-Sheep, "Come and visitmeto-morrow."
Thenextmorning Mountain-Sheep went toCoyote's camp. Coyote
said tohisboy,"Godown tothecreeknowanddipupsome water,

Sohecutuptheback ofthedress insmall pieces andputthem into

wife's dress didnotcome back likethat oftheMountain-Sheep's wife.
When theMountain-Sheep sawthatCoyote wastrying toimitate him,
theMountain-Sheep pulled offhisshirtandcutaway allbelow the

Hawk had fivesticks laidout,thesame asOtter hadhad. There was
adead tree justbelow Fish-Hawk's camp, leaning over the river.
Fish-Hawk had fivesmall holes cutintheicejustunder theleaning

that hisvisitor hadgone.
3.Coyote andFox.
Coyote andFoxwere short offood,andCoyote said,"Let usplan
togetmarried tosomeman!"^Foxanswered, "Buthowcanwe
marry menwhenwearemen ourselves?" Coyote said,"That is
easyenough! Wewilljustputonwomen's clothes, andtherest will
onlybegood talking." SoFoxagreed that itwasafineplan tomarry
some onethatway. They dressed upinwomen's dresses, andwent
toseetwoyoung unmarried Wolves. They toldtheseWolf brothers
that their parents hadsentthem outtotryand findgood husbands.
Then theWolves agreed tomarry them.
Then withgood talking Coyote toldtheWolves, "For fivedaysyou
cannot really marry us,butinstead must giveusfood totakehome to
ourparents." TheWolf brothers believed what Coyote said,because
they didnotrecognize him inthat disguise. SoforfivedaysCoyote
andFoxpretended totake asupply offoodhome totheir parents.
AttheendofthistimeCoyote didnotknowhow togetoutofthe
difficulty. Ontheevening ofthesixthdayhesaidtoFox,"Beready
allthetime,weshall leave forhome to-night. Now, theWolves had
two sisters whowere dwelling near their brothers' camp. After dark
Coyote went tothehouse ofthe girls; andwhen oneofthemwent
outside, heseized theother andviolated her. This girlmade agreat
cry;andwhenFoxheard thecry,hejumped upandran off.Coyote
ranaway also,andtheWolves never caught him.
4.Coyote andFoxgetFood.^
Coyote wasawiseman, andFoxwasslow-witted. Coyote said
toFox,"Now weshallhave togetupsomescheme toprocure food.
You areslow-witted, just likeyour father. Myfather wasnotthat
way: hewaswise. Ihave taken aftermyfather."
They were intheircamp; andCoyote said toFox, "Ifyoukeep
perfectly stillanddonotmove,weshall getsome food." Then Coyote
began thus: "Iwish that Iandmyfriend could hear thesound of
fivepacks offood falling atthedoor!" Then theyheard fivesounds:
"tlitluk, tlitluk, tlitluk, tlitluk, tlitluk!" Coyote jumped upandran
out,andthere hesaw fivepacks lying atthedoor. Hetook thethree
largest ones forhisshare, and leftthetwosmallest ones forFox.
The large packs thatCoyote gotwere alldrymeat without any fat,

butthetwo little packs contained finemeat. Inthree daysCoyote
hadeaten allhispoormeat; while Foxhadagreat deal left,because
hiswassovery rich.Onthefourth morning Coyote washungry, and
kept hiseyeonFoxtosee ifhehadeaten allhisshare. Now, Fox
hadeaten onlyoneofhispacks, soCoyote jumped overandtook the
other. Then hesaid toFox,"You areafinefellow never todivide
upwithyour friend!"
Fivetimes they repeated themagic actandgotfood, butthesixth
timeCoyote wanted toseewhobrought them themeat. Sohesaidto
Fox,"Iamgoing toseethemanwho gives usmeat." Fox replied,
"You hadbetter nottrytodothat, because this istheonlywaywe
cangetfood." ButCoyote wasdetermined tosee.Hestood atthe
door,andcutapeep-hole sothathecould lookoutwithoneeye.Then
herepeated thewish; andwhen thepacks fell,hesawamangoing
upover theridgewhowore long hair inawig. ThismanwasDeer-
Tick (piskyeye). Coyote shouted after him,"Oh,youmanwith the
wig!yougoover themountain!" Think youthey gotfood again
from themanCoyote hadshamed?^
5.Coyote andFoxrunRaces.^
TheMountain-Sheep (tinum), theElk(wewukie), theBlack-Tailed.
Deer (ye'ernes), theWhite-Tailed Deer (tatapaix), andtheMountain-
Goat {taxHsxis) outran allother animals. Thewager wasthatthose
whowere beaten should lose their heads. These fiveanimals always
won. Now, Coyote andFoxhappened tocome tothat place; and
Coyote saidtoFox,"Partner, wealso shall givethem arace,wetwo
against those five." Theymade achallenge, andarranged arace
with fiveBlack-Tailed Deer. Sothey ranalongway, crossing
gulches and hills; butwhen theracewasabout half over, Coyote
gave out,andFoxwas lefttofinish. Pretty soon the fiveBlack-
Tailed Deer gave outalso,andsoFoxwon therace. Then thefive
Black-Tailed Deer were beheaded inagulch, andCoyote andFox
devoured thebodies andrested. After this,Coyote andFoxranraces
witheach oftheother fourkinds ofanimals. Theywon alltheraces,
and killed thedefeated runners.
Noother animals dared torunwithCoyote andFox. Soon, how-
ever, thesetwogotfatfrom eating toomuch meat. Then Jack-Rabbit
{wilali'k) andWhite Mountain-Rabbit (palxts), andBald-Headed
Eagle {whptis), andGolden Eagle (soxontaix) ,andMagpie (ekex)
decided tochallenge them. Coyote saidtoFox,"Wehave beaten all
thegood runners; letusbeatthese aswell!" Theracewasalongone,

steep hillattheendofthecourse. ThenMagpie swooped down and
wontherace.
Coyote said tothevictors, "You arefinerunners, andhave beaten
usfairly. Just letmegetadrink ofwater, andthenyoumay cut
offmyhead." Sothey toldhimtogetadrink andcome back. Now,
down atthecreek there weresome children playing, andtheysaw
Coyote take offhisclothes andcrawl intothewater andunder aroot.
Aboycried out,"Here isCoyote! Come on!He iscrawling under
theroot!" They allpulled himoutandtookhimwhere Foxwas,
andthen theybeheaded both. ItdidCoyote nogood tohide after
hehad lost.
6.FoxANDCoyote asShamans.
Now, therewere several persons suffering from swellings ofthebody,^
andthey sent forFoxtotreatthem andmake theswelling goaway.
When these persons were nearly well,Coyote asked Foxforpermission
tohelp inthecuring. SoFox letCoyote actasshaman, andthe
patients grewworse again. Thishappened several times. Foxwould
make them better, andCoyote would turnround andmake them
worse. Byandbythesickonesordered Fox totellCoyote notto
help, because hewasnotagoodmedicine-man.^
7.Coyote andtheMoon.^
Moon*hadasonwhoused tositonthepoint ofahillandwatch
theup-river trailthatpassed near theircamp. Thesonused tokill
people andtake thebodies home tohisfather, whocooked andate
them; buttheprivate jDarts heate first,andwithout cooking. This
happened formany years, andCoyote learned ofit.AndCoyote
came towards that place; and, behold! therewasthatonefaroffon
the hill,watching forpeople. AndCoyote keptoutofsight, andmade
himself ahatofgrass. Whenever theMoon-Youth^turned hishead.
Coyote would creep closer, andthen lieflatonhisbellyandbevery

came towards me!" AndCoyote said,"Your father andmine used
tokeepwatch over there, where that Httle pileofstones is,whenever
itwascold.Many they killed, andnobody evertookthem unawares."
And, sureenough, thepileofstones was there, andthey built afire.
ThenMoon-Youth didnotknow what tothink. Andagain Coyote
spoke: "We arethirsty, butyonder isaspring ofverygood water;
letusgetadrink!" They went there, and, sureenough, Moon-
Youth found thespring. Coyote said,"Now, drink!" butMoon-
Youth had hisclub inhishand: soCoyote said,"Letmehold itfor
you!" andhegave theclub toCoyote, andleaned over todrink from
thespring. Then Coyote struck Moon-Youth with theclubandkilled
him.Heexchanged clothes with that one,andcarried thebodyup
tothehouse. The oldMoon heard thefalling load,andcried out,
"Son, bringhimin!"AndthenMoon tookouthisknifeandcutoff
theprivate parts andatethem. Andhenoticed adifference; and
hesaid,"This meat isalmost toostrong," buthecooked therestof
thebody, andoffered some oftheflesh toCoyote, whopretended to
be ill,andatenothing.
Then itcame evening, andthey laydown tosleep. Coyote collected
hisbelongings, and stoleaway from theoldman. Hetravelled till
itwasnearly morning, andthen said tohimself, "It isgetting day-
light; Iwillgotosleep, orelse Ishall betoosleepy fortheday."
ThenMoon arose from hisbed,andsawhimsleeping there justby
thedoorway ofthehouse. "How isthis?" hesaid tohim,"you
must have hadanightmare during thenight." And itsurprised
Coyote. "Ithought Ihad travelled agreat distance," hesaid to
himself.
Andagain itwasgrowing dark, andagain Coyote setout,and as-
sured himself thathehadindeed travelled alongway; buthewas
only justoutside thedoorway ofthehouse. AndagainMoon arose,
andfound him sleeping right there, butdidnotrecognize him as
Coyote rather than hisson.Thus itwas forthree times; andthen
Coyote decided tokillMoon, forfearthelatter would soon seethe
difference. SoCoyote killed him,and said, "After thisyou will kill
nolonger, butwillgive light fortravel atnight-time; andnowand
thenmen ofimportance willknow Coyote's moon."^And thus it
happened.

her; butCoyote (itseyeye) thought something like thismust have
happened tomake theriver godry.Hewent upstream, because he
knew theplacewhere thewater hadbeen stopped. Ashetravelled
upthedrybed,hemade fiverafts,andplaced themabout fivebends of
theriver apart.
Atthehead oftheriver hesawalodge. Hewasnearly dead of
thirst when hearrived; soheentered thelodge. Inside hesawa
mountain-sheep-horn bucket ofwater, andhesaid tothewoman,
"Pass thatwater over tome; Ihavedrunk agreat deal ofwater
along theriver to-day, still Iamvery dry." Sohedrank upallthe
water.
Coyote laydown ontheopposite sideofthelodge from thewoman,
andcovered hishead with hisblanket. Buthehadaneye-hole in
theblanket; andhesawher rise,take theempty bucket, anddipup
water fromwhere shehadbeen sitting. After this.Coyote aroseand
went out.
Near that place hespatuponsome tulerushes, and toldthem to
givewar-whoops after hehadre-entered thelodge. Sohewent again
intothelodge, andsoon therewasagreat noise ofwar-whoops. He
saidoutloud tohimself, "Ithought Iheard something when Iwas
outside." But forallhisstrategy, theFrogwidow would notbudge
fromwhere shesat.SoCoyote seized herbythearmandjerked her
up.Then thewater came out.When thewater wasrunning freely,
hethrew thewoman intothestream, saying, "This isthewayyou
willalways be :whenever highwater comes, itwillalways carry frogs
down theriver."
Coyote then started downstream, running asfastashecould. When
hereached theplace ofthe first raft,hefound ithadbroken adrift.
Soheranontothenext one,andfound italso adrift; andthethird
thesame, andthefourth. Hereached the fifth, however, justasit
wasbreaking loose, andmanaged tojump aboard. Then hewent
down theriverontheraft. This ishowCoyote recovered thewater
from Frog.
9.Grizzly-Bear andCoyote.^
Grizzly-Bear wasachief, andCoyote wasjealous ofhim. Now,
Coyote hadmany friends whowould dowhatever hetoldthem todo.
Hearose early inthemorning, andannounced that therewould bea
great hunt thatday,andthathehimself would take part init.So
thepeople allwent out,andwiththemwent Grizzly-Bear.
Coyote told hisfriends justwhat todowhen they arrived atthe

Hetold allthepeople where tohunt, andhestationed sixofhisfriends
inthehunting-ground ofGrizzly-Bear. Coyote hadsome arrows
poisoned with rattlesnake-poison. Hegaveonearrow toeach ofhis
friends. These men waited forGrizzly-Bear with their arrows on
theirbows.
Coyote said toGrizzly-Bear, "Ifyouseeobjects likemen, donot
beafraid, forthey areonly rocks." When Grizzly-Bear sawthemen,
hqwasafraid; butCoyote shouted tohim,"Donotbeatallafraid!"
Grizzly-Bear wentupclose tothemen,andthey shothimwith their
arrows. When hewasdead, they skinned himandtookhim into
camp. The sister andwife ofGrizzly-Bear were inthiscamp along
with thesixhunters.
When Coyote came intocamp, hewent around andmade aspeech
toallthepeople, bidding them toagreat feastwhen thegame they
hadtaken wascooked. Soon themeatwascooked anddressed up
finely. Then every onewas called intothefeast. The sister and
wife ofGrizzly-Bear were called inwith therest ;andassoon asthey
entered, theyknew from thesmell that themeatwasGrizzly-Bear
meat. The tears rolled from their eyes; buttheywere afraid of
Coyote, andsaidnothing.
The wifeand sistermade uptheirminds togetrevenge. Their
planwastogowith thehunters and killthem onebyone. Butthere
wasaBlack-Bear incampwhoheard theplanning ofthetwowomen,
andtoldCoyote. Asaresult ofthis.Coyote didnotsend outthe
hunters onebyone,butinbands ofthreeand four.When thewife
ofGrizzly-Bear was killed, thatputanend toitall.Ayounger
brother andthesister were spared, sothat there would always be
grizzly bears inthecountry. That isthereason there are stillgrizzly
bears.

Coyote was travelling upSnake River when hesaw fiveMallard-
Duck girlsswimming near theother side.Hewatched them tillhis
desires were aroused. Then hethought outaplan tosatisfy himself

Then theeldest Mallard-Duck girlgrewvery ill.Coyote wentdown
river ashort distance andswam across. Then hecame upstream to
the girls'camp, where theeldest onewasalmost dead. These girls
recognized Coyote, and said toeach other, "Coyote, themedicine-
manhascome." They asked himtocure thesick girl.Hetoldthe
sisters tocloseupallthechinks inthelodge, sothatnoonecould

Then hecopulated again with theMallard-Duck girl,andrecovered
theendofhispenis.
II.Coyote intheBuffalo Country.^
Justbefore Coyote reached theBuffalo country, hecame toanold
buffalo-bull lying down. Hehadbeen gored andtornbyanother
buffalo-bull, andwasbadly crippled. Coyote walked around Buffalo
andlooked him over. Then Coyote took offhisbreech-cloth and
urinated inBuffalo's face. SoBuffalo said toCoyote, "Coyote,
youhave treated meshamefully, although youseethat Iambadly
hurt. Ihadtenwives, butanother bulltookthem frommeand
crippled methus."
Now, thisBuffalo that talked toCoyote wasvery old,and his
horns were dulland short. Coyote asked Buffalo where theother
onewasthathadtaken thetenwives, andBuffalo replied thathe
ranged close by.Then Coyote said, "Iwillmake youasetofnew
horns; Iwillbathe youandcureyou;andwhen yougetwell,youcan
recover your wives. But ifIcure you,andyourecover thewives,
Iwant oneofthem totakehome withme."
Buffalo agreed togivehimone. SoCoyote went toasmall creek
anddugabathing-hole intheground, and filled itwith water. Then
heheated apile ofstones andputthem intothewater. Buffalo
bathed inthishotwater forfivedays, andattheendofthese fivedays
hewasentirely well. Then Buffalo laydown, andCoyote went to
work onhishorns. With hisflint knife hescraped andpointed the

Then theywentontomeet theothers.
Now,when Coyote andBuffalo came insight oftheothers, the
young bullthathaddefeated theoldonerecognized theenemy whose
wives hehadstolen, buthedidnotseeCoyote. HemetoldBuffalo,
andtried toforcehimback; butaftertheyhadfought foratime,and
hadbegun togrow tired, theolder onecaught theother intheflank,
andtoreagreat holethat lettheentrails out.Theyoung bull died,
andtheoldonegathered uphisoldwives aswellasthose ofhisvictim.
Coyote devoured asmuch ofthedead Buffalo's flesh ashecould
hold; thenhesaid,"Well, Ihavehadenough now; givemeoneofthe
Buffalo-Cows forawife,and Iwillgohome." SoCoyote picked out
onetotakewith him;andBuffalo toldCoyote, "This Buffalo-Cow
must gowithyou forten fulldays before youdare totouch her."
Coyote agreed towait tendays, andthey started.
Coyote took thelead, and thecow followed him.When night
came, theywould sleep atadistance fromeach other. The sixthday
Buffalo-Cow could talk toCoyote alittle, andontheeighth daythe
Buffalo-Cow turned intoaCoyote woman. After thishadhappened,
Coyote could hardly keep hisvow. Thetenth dayshesleptonthe
opposite side ofthe fire,andCoyote could notsleep. When itwas
nearly daylight. Coyote crept over towhere shewasandtouched her.
Assoon ashedid this, shejumped upasabuffalo-cow again, and
rushed out. Coyote satbythe fireandhowled, while Buffalo-Cow
wentback totheherd.
Then Coyote decided hewould gobackandgether.Hethought
hewould know better next time. When hearrived attheBuffalo
camp. Coyote told Buffalo-Bull thathehadhadanightmare that
last night, andhadfrightened away hisnew wife. Then Buffalo-
Bull toldCoyote, "She willnotgoasecond time;nowyou willhave
togohome alone."
Coyote said,"This country willalways bethisway.When aman
starts backfrom herewithanew wife, hewillalways loseherbefore
hegetshome."
12.Coyote oftheLower Country.^
Coyote made uphismind onemorning thathewould gotothe
Buffalo country too. Sohestarted. Hewasready forwar,andhad

thetent, the girlrecognized himasamedicine-man. Soshesaidto
him,"The people have allgone offand leftme. Iwishyouwould

Thehornwasprojecting justenough toofferahold forhisteeth.
SoCoyote tookhold ofitinthisway,andeasily pulled itout. Coyote
gathered some rootsand leaves, andpounded themupandputthem
onthewound. Inafewdays the girlwas well. Then shemarried
Coyote, andthey followed upthecamps tilltheycameupon therest
ofthepeople.
Inthatcamp therewasanother Coyote, whomade aspeech tothe
people, relating howthe girlthathadbeen leftbehind was incamp
again after having been cured byastrange Coyote. Inreality, this
affair wasnottotheliking oftheCoyote whomade thespeech.
While thestrange Coyote and hiswifewere staying atthecamp,
preparations wereunderwaytosendoutawar-party, andsinging was
taking place. SothisCoyote told hiswifethathetoowasgoing to
war,butforhertocontinue withhim untilcamp wasbroken. That
night, however, shedidnotcome back tohim: shehadeloped with
another.
Coyote feltvery badly over this,and said, "Well, Ifeelpretty
badly. Stillthething cannot behelped. Others will feelasbadly
asIwhen theygototheBuffalo country and their wives runaway
fromthem." Sadly hewentback tohisformer home, andsince that
timewives have often runaway from theirhusbands intheBuffalo
country.

When themancame home, heasked thechildren where their
mother was. Atfirstthey didnothketotellhim,butafter awhile
theydecided totellhimthetruth. Hescolded them, and said,"You
arewicked children, and Idonotwish tolivewithyouanylonger."
Soheturned himself intoanoldflint-lock gun.
Now, these children hadoften heard their father talkabout their
grandfather, who lived notfaraway. They lefttheirhome andtook
the trail. OnthewayanOwl-Monster (Palxhotske)^sawthem.
When theywereaware that theOwl-Monster hadseenthem, they
turned upapiece ofmoss, crawled under it,andbecame grubs. Then
theOwl-Monster searched forthem, and finally found thetwogrubs.
Heputthem into hispack-bag, andcarried them offupon hisback.
The little girlsaid tothe little boy,"Let ustrysomething!" So
theychanged their voices, andshouted from afar off.They called
out,"TheImnaha widow's children ar.eonfire!" Then theychanged
themselves into realpersons, andwereheavy tocarry. Pretty soon
theOwl-Monster grew very tired, andshestopped andhungupthe
bagupon thelimb ofatree. Shewanted togethome atonce toher
children. When shewasoutofsight, thechildren kicked thebagto
pieces, andobtained their freedom. Then they ranasfastasthey
could toward theplacewhere their father hadtoldthem their grand-
father lived. When theycame totheside oftheriver opposite his
lodge, they called outforhim tocome overandrescue them from a
monster thatpursued them. The firsttime hepaidnoattention
totheir cries ;andthesecond timehetoldthem thathehadnogrand-
children except those whose mother hadbecome araven, andwhose
father hadbecome aflint-lock gun.
When theOwl-Monster found that herchildren were safe, she
hastened back toherbag,andlearned thatthechildren hadescaped.
Shetracked themdown towards the river. Butwhen theOwl-
Monster wasalmost there, thegrandfather recognized hisgrand-
children, andstretched hislegoutacross theriver, andthendrew it
back with thechildren upon it.Hehidthem under acanoe hewas
hewing out.
Then theOwl-Monster came totheriver-bank andshouted tobe
taken across. The oldman grew tired. Soheasked Butterfly
(xlapslap), Crawfish (tula), Mussel (sewts), Bullhead (kilsus), and
Swallow (lautixtix) togooverandgettheOwl-Monster. They had
acanoe made ofwild-parsnip (ais). When theyasked hertostep in,
theboatwassounsteady thatshewas afraid, andstepped outagain.
Sothey toldherthecanoe would runsteady ifshetiedrocks around
herneckandbody. Shedidthis;andwhen shestepped aboard, the

14.FrogandBluejay.^
Frog hadasmooth pole setintheground, andwith ithehad
devised ameans ofkilling offallthebirds.Aracewould berunup
thispole,andwhoever gottothetop firstwould cutofftheother one's
head. Thepoleleaned alittle ;andFrogwould getontheupper side,
andmake theopponent getontheunder side. Thus Frog continued
towinraces foralong time,andmanaged tokilloffmany birds.
Coyote was inthiscamp. Hebecame afraid thatFrogwasgoing
tokill offallthebirds. SoCoyote gave abig feast, andinvited
every onetoattend. Hewanted thepeople towork outaplan to
getthebest ofFrog; butevery onewasafraid torunhimarace.
After ascheme hadbeen devised, Bluejay (kuyeskuyes) undertook the
job;andCoyote made aspeech, calling everybody tothepole,and
announcing that therewastobearacebetween FrogandBluejay.
Now, littleFrogbecame uneasy, andfeared thatBluejay wasgoing
towinandthen killher. Sowhen theywere halfway tothetop.
Frog tried tokickBluejay offthepole.When theywere nearly to
thetop,Bluejay used hiswings andflewtherestoftheway. Hegot
tothetop first.When Frog gottothetop,Bluejay kicked her,and
she felltotheground andwas killed. Ever since thatracethere have
beennofeathers onthesideofBluejay's face,because Froghadtorn
them alloffwhen shetried toknock Bluejay from thepole.
After theracewasover, Coyote made aspeech, saying, "Hereafter
there willbefrogs ontheearth, butthey willnever hurtanyone.
People willhear thefrogs singing, andthenthey willknow thatwarm
weather iscoming."
15.TheDiving Beaver.^
Beaver {taxapul) hadaplan tokill oflfallanimals thatcould dive.
Thisplanwastohave atestofstaying under water tilloneortheother
wasdead. Just after daylight Otter andBeaver hadadiving-test.
The rest ofthepeople satonthebankandwatched. When itwas
almost evening. Otter floated updead. After this,Beaver cameup
alive. SoBeaver keptupthese tests, and killed offdifferent animals.
Soon allwere afraid ofBeaver, andnonewould divewith him.
Coyote called thepeople together, andasked them tomake upa
plan tokillBeaver athisowngame. TheMud-Hen (mtiitex) said,
"Let ustryoncemore!" Now,Mud-Hen hadmade aplanwith

Mountain-Woodpecker (weqinqiunux) .This planwas asfollows:
Mountain-Woodpecker was toboreahole inthebottom ofacanoe
thatwasontheriver, andMud-Hen wastostick herhead outofthis
holewhere noonecould seeher.
SoBeaver andMud-Hen dove, andMountain-Woodpecker sat
over thehole inthecanoe andpulled outtheplug. Mud-Hen put
herhead outthrough thisholeandwent tosleep. Just before dark
therewasastream ofbubbles, andthenBeaver cameupdead. Pretty
soonMountain-Woodpecker woke upMud-Hen, and said,"Beaver
hascomeupdead :nowyouwould better divedown andcomeupin
themiddle oftheriver." SoMud-Hen dove down, andcameup
again some distance from thecanoe.
16.TheSunandtheMoon.^
TheSunhadtwowives, Frogandanother woman. Then theSun
moved across theskysovery hot,that thepeople were nearly killed
bytheheat. They didnotlikethisstate ofaffairs. Forthatreason
Coyote called acouncil ofallthepeople; andheknewSundidnot
love Frog, andwould notinvite hertocome, sohebegged herto
come tothecouncil andobeywhatSuntoldhertodo.
Soshewentandstood atthedoor, and said,"My husband, where
am Itosit?"andhetoldher,"Here, onmyeye." Then sheadvanced
afewsteps andjumped uptohiseye;andthepeople tried topull
her off,butcould not.AndCoyote toldtheSun,"You areacting
badly forachief;" andCoyote decided thatSunshould become the
night sun(Moon), andthat theMoon should become theSun. So
theirregular one isnowtheMoon, andthefrog isseenover hiseye.

while Wildcat took pityonthe girl.Hetoldhertodigforhimahole
intheground outside ofthecamp, where hecould bathe. Shedid
this,and filled theholewith water, andthenputstones onafireand
heated them, andthenputthehotstones intothewater. Early in
themorning shecarried Wildcat down tothebathing-place and left

woman came outandinvited Magpie toenter. Shegavehimfood

"Get your belongings andcome back to-night and livewith us,but
donot tellanyoneexcept yourownfamily."
Now, ithadbeen foggy ever since Wildcat uncovered hishead,
after being abandoned bythepeople. Magpie waited until dark
before going intocamp, thenhegave themeat tohiswifeandchildren.
Some people looked inatthedoor,andsawtheMagpies eating ameal,
while every oneelsewashungry. After this,hetoldthemwhere he
hadobtained hismeat. Then Coyote made another speech, saying,
"Magpie hasbeenback toouroldcamp, where weabandoned those
persons. They have plenty ofmeat there." Nextmorning hemade
another speech. Hesaid,"Everybody gettogether their belongings,
andwewillmove back totheplacewhere Wildcat lives." When the

hebecame thehead chief ofthevillage.

alittle frogdown herear.HesaidtoGrizzly-Bear, "Aunt, Idropped
one lousedown your ear." She replied, "Then dighim out."
Raccoon put inhisfinger, butcould notreach the frog. Then
Grizzly-Bear thought ofherlongbone needle, andshegave thisto
Raccoon todigoutthelouse. Raccoon puttheneedle inplace
intheear,andthengave itaheavy blow with his fistand killed
Grizzly-Bear. Then Raccoon climbed down outofthe tree,and
started forhome.
Raccoon told hisgrandmother that hehad killed Grizzly-Bear.
Then theywentandcutherup.Now, Raccoon's grandmother had

Raccoon hadstepped outside, sheputonthehide,andthuschanged
herself intoagrizzly bear. Raccoon came back after theoldwoman
hadgone offintothebrush. Hecould notfindheraround camp, so
hetracked heroutinto thebrush. Then heheard thesound of
