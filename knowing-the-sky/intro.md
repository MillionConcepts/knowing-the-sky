## Introduction

Welcome to *Knowing the Sky*. This is a NASA TOPST (Transform to OPen Science Training) project meant to teach open science skills relevant to planetary science and astronomy. In particular, we focus on the software tools available within the Python ecosystem that are most commonly used with planetary science and astronomy, though many of these tools overlap with other disciplines.

### Our approach

*Knowing the Sky* is a self-paced, narrative-driven, interactive textbook. We believe that learning open science skills is more effective in context than in a vacuum. Therefore, each lesson leads learners through exciting hands-on investigations of Native knowledge concepts relating to astronomy and planetary science.

### Why Native narratives?
We assert that both Native cosmologies and Western scientific disciplines are legitimate bodies of knowledge. We hope that exposing learners to Native knowledge concepts (mainly from the Shinnecock and Salish tribes) will (1) help break the cycle of numerical underrepresentation of Natives in the STEM workforce and cultural exclusion by demonstrating Native people and culture continue to contribute to science and (2) help non-Native users build cultural competencies along with open science skills.

### Who is this for?

*Knowing the Sky* aims for a broad audience. Anyone from interested laypeople to experienced scientists can benefit from this course. This project looks to fill the gap of training materials in the intermediate to advanced space. While there are hundreds of resources available online for the very basics of Python and detailed documentation of specific packages for highly advanced users, **Knowing the Sky** targets the space inbetween. We link to both more introductory and more advanced content as we move through the lessons so those with either the need for more explanation or the want to go deeper into a given topic can do so. 

We heavily encourage users that have experience with other closed-source languages popular in planetary science and astronomy such as IDL and Matlab to take advantage of these resources. Throughout the lessons we point out major differences between these languages and Python so your transition to open science is made easier.

### What will I learn?

This course is meant to help users gain several types of competency necessary to build the open science ecosystem and facilitate scientific research:
accessing and analyzing publicly-available NASA data (including cloud-based datasets) 
using both general and discipline-specific open-source software libraries for data access, manipulation, analysis, and visualization
creating, managing, and sharing open science workflows.

Feel free to pursue our [table of contents](table_of_contents.md) to get an idea of what the lessons cover. There are also learning objectives that cover the skills taught and python packages introduced at the beginning of each lesson. You may start on the lessons that interest you the most, but be aware that later lessons assume you are familiar with the skills taught within the prior lessons and narrative content builds on prior notebooks within a given section.
